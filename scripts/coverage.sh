# Test coverage for the Rust workspace, measured by cargo-llvm-cov.
#
#   ./scripts/coverage.sh          # summary table on stdout, reports under target/llvm-cov/
#   ./scripts/coverage.sh --open   # the same, then open the HTML report in a browser
#
# A function no test calls is the gap worth looking at, so the last thing
# printed is the count of those functions and the files with the most of
# them. Coverage says nothing about whether a test would catch a change;
# scripts/mutants.sh measures that. Don't write tests to raise the count.
# target/llvm-cov/uncovered-functions.txt names every uncovered function
# with its line. Line coverage is in the table and the HTML report but is
# not a target. Also written: target/llvm-cov/html/index.html (per-file,
# per-line view), target/llvm-cov/lcov.info (for editor plugins),
# target/llvm-cov/summary.txt (the table) and functions.txt (the headline).
#
# Needs cargo-llvm-cov (`cargo install cargo-llvm-cov --locked`), the
# llvm-tools rustup component, which rust-toolchain.toml installs, and
# python3 for scripts/uncovered-functions.py. The
# instrumented build lives under target/llvm-cov-target, apart from plain
# `cargo build` output, so the first run compiles the workspace from scratch.
# ffmpeg on PATH matters: the transcode and media tests skip themselves
# without it, and what they would have called then shows as uncovered.
# src-tauri is not a workspace member and is not measured; its commands are
# thin wrappers over the exporter, import, and export crates, which are.
# Test code itself (tests/ directories and the <module>/tests.rs files) is
# left out of the numbers. Coverage is a report, never a gate:
# docs/adr/0007-ci-is-the-only-gate.md. The Coverage workflow runs this
# same script on every push to main and keeps the reports as artifacts.
