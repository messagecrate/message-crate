-- given the same id is found by it.

-- Contentless FTS5 index over each earlier version of an edited message
-- (message_versions.text), one row per version under the version's id.
-- Separate from messages_fts so a search can tell a message it found by its
-- final text from one it found only by an earlier version, and say which
-- version that was. Same tokenizer, so a word matches the same way in both.
