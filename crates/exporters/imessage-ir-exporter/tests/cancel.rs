//! Cancelling an Apple Messages run while `imessage-reader` is running.
//!
//! The test sits in a test binary of its own because it finds the reader
//! among this process's children: in `helper_process.rs` other tests start
//! readers at the same time, and one of theirs could not be told from this
//! one. The children are listed with `ps`, so the test runs on Unix only.
