//! SMS Backup & Restore's backup format, in both directions: [`read_backup`]
//! turns `smses.xml` into the shared conversation structure
//! ([`message_ir::ConversationDocument`]) every exporter writes, and
//! [`SbrArchive`] writes the SMS and MMS of conversations back out as one
//! `smses.xml`.
//!
//! Library entry: [`run`] for the full export pipeline.
