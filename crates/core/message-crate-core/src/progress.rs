//! Typed progress events an exporter run reports while it works.
//!
//! Log lines ([`crate::LogSink`]) are for people. Progress events are for
//! whatever draws a progress bar: the desktop app renders them, and nothing
//! has to read counts back out of prose. Every event names the stage it
//! belongs to and carries the counts that stage has, so a caller can match
//! on the variant and use the fields without parsing anything.
//!
//! The events are emitted from the shared write layer (`message-staging`'s
//! `ExportWriter` and write queue, `message-ir-format`'s `FormatSink`, and
//! this crate's attachment stager) and from the few exporter-specific loops
//! that have progress worth showing (iMessage's message stream and its
//! backup-decrypt setup steps).
