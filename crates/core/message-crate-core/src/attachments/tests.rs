//! Content-addressed naming.
//!
//! This module had no tests at all, which mutation testing showed plainly:
//! every function in it could be replaced with a constant — `digest_prefix`
//! with `""`, `attachment_dest_name` with `"xyzzy"` — and the whole
//! workspace suite stayed green.
//!
//! What breaks if it does: the destination name is what makes an attachment
//! content-addressed, so two exports of the same photo land on the same
//! file. A constant name collapses every attachment in an export onto one
//! file.
