//! `imessage-reader`: reads Apple Messages for the Message Crate desktop app.
//!
//! This program exists for a licence reason, not a product one. It links
//! `imessage-database` and `crabapple`, which are GPL-3.0-or-later, and the
//! desktop app is under the Fair Core License, so the two cannot be one
//! binary. The app starts this one, writes a request on its stdin, and reads
//! events off its stdout; the protocol is `imessage-reader-protocol`. Nothing
//! here is meant to be typed at a shell, and ADR 0001's rule (no command line
//! except the server) still stands: an internal helper the app spawns
//! is not a command line for people.
//!
//! Parts of `backup.rs` and `error.rs` are adapted from `imessage-exporter`
//! by Christopher Sardegna, GPL-3.0-or-later; each file says which parts.
//! That is the other reason this program is GPL: it is a modified version of
//! GPL code, not only a user of GPL libraries.
//!
//! What it does: opens `chat.db` (or decrypts an iPhone backup), caches
//! chats, handles, contacts and tapbacks, then streams every message as an
//! already-classified record. It also decrypts one domain of an encrypted
//! iPhone backup into a directory (`domain.rs`), which is how WhatsApp's files
//! come out of one: `crabapple` is the only code here that can decrypt a
//! backup, and it is on this side of the boundary. Turning those records into the shared
//! conversation structure, writing files, media handling and everything else
//! the product does stays in the app.
