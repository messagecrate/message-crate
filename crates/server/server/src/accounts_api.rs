//! The accounts collection: `/v1/accounts` and everything under a member.
//! API tokens, `/v1/accounts/{id}/api-tokens`, are in the `api_tokens`
//! submodule.
//!
//! One collection serves the owner and every account. Who may call a
//! route is decided here, per handler, never by the path: the owner reaches
//! every row, an account reaches its own, and a stranger may create one while
//! the server is open. `docs/architecture/http-api.md` records the rule and the
//! role prefix it replaced.
//!
//! The owner manages accounts, not the contents of other people's accounts, so
//! nothing here reads `messages.body`, `attachments.transcription`, or any
//! other content column: a row carries who an account is, what it may do and
//! how much it holds, never what it says.
//! See `docs/adr/0008-the-owner-holds-no-messages.md`.
