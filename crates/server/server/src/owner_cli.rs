//! The two shell commands that reach the owner's credentials.
//!
//! Claiming a Message Crate and getting back into one are different jobs, so they are
//! different commands: `create-owner` refuses a Message Crate that already has an
//! owner, `reset-owner-password` refuses one that does not. Neither can be
//! mistaken for the other, so setting up a Message Crate cannot silently overwrite a
//! live owner's password.
//!
//! A shell on the server is the right credential for both. Nothing inside the
//! product can reset the owner's password, because no account stands above
//! the owner. See `docs/adr/0008-the-owner-holds-no-messages.md`.
