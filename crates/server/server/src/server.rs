//! Router assembly, shared state, auth resolution, and HTTP plumbing.
//!
//! Domain handlers live in their own modules: `session_api` (logging in and
//! out), `accounts_api` (the accounts collection and their API tokens),
//! `contacts_api`, `conversations_api`, `exports_api` (Export Runs),
//! `imports_api` (JSONL ingest and Import Runs), and `assets_api` (asset bytes and
//! multipart uploads). This module
//! keeps the pieces they share: [`AppState`], [`ApiError`], Bearer token
//! resolution, body-streaming helpers, and `http_app`, which assembles the
//! router.
