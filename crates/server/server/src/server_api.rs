//! What a logged-out browser is allowed to know about this Message Crate, and the one
//! act it is allowed to perform: claiming an unclaimed Message Crate.
//!
//! `GET /v1/server` reports this Message Crate's state as a single value rather than the
//! two facts behind it — whether an owner exists, and whether public
//! registration is on — so that the rule joining them is stated once, on the
//! server. A browser and a desktop app that each derived the entry screen from
//! raw fields would be two copies of one rule, free to drift apart.
//!
//! It also reports the attachment size limit, because a program that uploads
//! has to know it before it starts and only the owner reads the settings.
//!
//! These are the server's only unauthenticated routes besides logging in and
//! a stranger's `POST /v1/accounts`, and the first read routes that do not
//! require a session: the entry screen cannot have one yet, which is the
//! whole of the exception. See
//! `docs/adr/0008-the-owner-holds-no-messages.md`.
