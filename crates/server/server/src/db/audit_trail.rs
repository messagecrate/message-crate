//! The Audit Trail: what each user did on this Message Crate, and when.
//!
//! The record is three tables read as one list. `audit_entries` holds
//! everything that has no record of its own: sessions, refused logins, and the
//! owner's and holders' changes to accounts. Import Runs and Export Runs stay
//! in `imports` and `exports` and are not copied. [`page`] reads all three in
//! time order, and adds a `session_ended` entry with the reason `expired` for
//! each session that ran out with nothing to end it, so expiry needs no write.
//!
//! An entry is written once. No route changes or deletes one; the only
//! deletion is [`trim_refused_logins`], for refused logins as a username no
//! account holds, after [`UNKNOWN_USERNAME_RETENTION_DAYS`]. Deleting an
//! account keeps its entries and runs ([`prepare_account_deletion`]).
//! A password, a session token and an API token never enter the trail, and
//! nothing here says what a message said or which conversation it was in
//! (`docs/adr/0008-the-owner-holds-no-messages.md`,
//! `docs/adr/0020-the-audit-trail-outlives-the-account.md`).
