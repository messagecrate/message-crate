//! How much an account, or the whole database, holds: row counts, the bytes its
//! attachments take, and what the database itself takes on disk. Every
//! number here describes message data without being it, which is what lets
//! the owner read them
//! (`docs/adr/0008-the-owner-holds-no-messages.md`, "What the owner
//! may see"). The per-account and all-account figures come from the same
//! queries with and without an account filter, so the total on Owner Home
//! cannot drift from the numbers on an account's Storage tab.
//!
//! The database sizes are measured, never estimated. The
//! one estimate is each account's share of message storage, which is the
//! measured messages figure split by the account's share of text.
