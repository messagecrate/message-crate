//! Shared storage for named sets (Message Tags and Contact Groups).
//!
//! Both domains store a named set (rows in a names table) whose members are
//! conversation or contact ids. The HTTP layer addresses a set by id through
//! `list_sets`, `get_set`, `create_set`, `rename_set`, `delete_set`,
//! `list_member_ids_of`, and `patch_members`. Only tests fill a set by name,
//! through `set_membership`, which creates the name on demand.
//! The operations are identical apart from table and column names, reserved
//! names, and one post-change hook, so this module implements them once
//! behind [`MembershipSpec`].
