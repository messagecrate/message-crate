//! The trash marker tables: `trashed_conversations` and `trashed_contacts`.
//!
//! A row in either table is a soft-delete flag; the conversation or contact
//! it points at is untouched until [`delete_trashed`] or [`empty_trash`]
//! removes it for good (or [`purge_account`] and account deletion clear the
//! markers along with everything else). Both marker operations first check
//! that the target row belongs to `account_id` — explicitly, through
//! [`crate::db::ownership`], rather than inferring ownership from whether an
//! insert or delete affected a row. That is what lets [`restore`] tell "not
//! this account's id" (`false`) apart from "this account's id, and it was not
//! trashed" (`true`, a no-op): a `DELETE` that matches zero rows looks
//! identical in both cases.
//!
//! Trashing something already trashed, and restoring something not trashed,
//! both return `true` — these operations are idempotent, per the HTTP routes
//! built on top of them.
//!
//! A conversation and a contact are trashed the same way, so one pair of
//! functions covers both and [`Trashable`] carries which is meant. The marker
//! table and its id column come from that enum and nowhere else, so no part
//! of a request reaches the SQL text.
//!
//! # Permanent deletion
//!
//! Trash is the only door to permanent deletion (CONTEXT.md, "Trash").
//! [`delete_trashed`] refuses a row that is not in the trash, so nothing can
//! be destroyed without having been set aside first, and both it and
//! [`empty_trash`] run inside one transaction so a failure part-way leaves
//! the database as it was.
//!
//! A conversation is deleted outright: the row goes and the schema's cascades
//! take its messages, attachments, tapbacks, participants and tag memberships
//! with it. A contact is not deleted: deleting a trashed contact does what a
//! phone's Delete Contact does — the name and the person's edits go, the row
//! stays as an Unknown contact holding the same handles, and every
//! conversation it was in is untouched and now shows the handle. The two are
//! still one operation to the caller ("Delete" on a trash row), so they share
//! [`delete_trashed`].
//!
//! An import is the other way out of the trash. When it meets a handle that
//! belongs to a trashed contact, it makes a fresh contact from the backup, as
//! a first import would, moves that handle to it, and
//! [`discard_trashed_contact`] deletes the trashed contact outright — row,
//! Contact Group memberships and marker — after taking off each handle it
//! still held, so one in a conversation goes to a new contact with no name
//! (ADR-0013). A backup that still holds
//! the person is the person saying they still talk to them.
