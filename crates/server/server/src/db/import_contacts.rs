//! What one import run did to each contact: the `import_contacts`
//! table.
//!
//! An import creates contacts, names them, and adds handles to them, and

//! run writes a reason for each contact it touches as it stages, in the same
//! transaction, so the record says what the import decided rather than what
//! timestamps suggest afterwards. The run's Contact Group, its new and
//! changed counts, and `GET /v1/imports/{id}/contacts` all read this table.
