//! The one query that decides the name shown for a participant.
//!
//! ADR-0006: the Contact's name, else what that backup called them in that
//! conversation, else the handle.
//!
//! Every participant has a handle: a person the source named with no address
//! has a handle of type `other` holding the name. So the name is never empty.
//!
//! Every route that names a participant calls
//! [`load_for_conversations`], so one person cannot show two names on one
//! screen. A participant's Contact is the one its handle is on in
//! `contact_handles`, which is what makes renaming a Contact, or moving the
//! handle to another, reach every conversation at once.
//!
//! One conversation shape has no participants rows to read at all: a backup
//! that recorded the thread's address and nothing about who was in it.
//! [`load_for_conversations`] answers for that shape too, from the
//! conversation's own chat handle, so a caller never has to know the shape
//! exists or carry a second naming path of its own. Only a one-to-one
//! conversation's chat handle is a person's address; a group's chat handle is
//! the group's own id, such as `chat1000000005`, so a group with no
//! participants rows has no participants. Reading one conversation's
//! messages and listing conversations therefore name the same person the same
//! way; while the fallback lived beside the list, a message page showed no one
//! at all for such a thread.
