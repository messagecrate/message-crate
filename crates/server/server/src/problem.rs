//! The registry of problem types: what each kind of failure is, the status it
//! answers, the page that describes it (`docs/architecture/http-api.md`).
//!
//! This is the one place a type is declared. [`crate::server::ApiError`] names
//! one per variant, the OpenAPI document describes the body through
//! [`Problem`], and `dump-error-docs` ([`crate::error_docs`]) writes one page
//! per type under `docs/src/content/docs/docs/developer/reference/errors/`
//! from the same declarations, so nothing has to be kept in step by hand.
