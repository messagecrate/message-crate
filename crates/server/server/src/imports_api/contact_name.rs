/// Every participant an import meets becomes a contact. ADR-0006: a backup is
/// an address book the person already curated, so the name it supplies goes on
/// the contact — on creation, or later if the contact has no name, whatever
/// made it: an earlier backup, an address book load, or the person. A contact
/// that already has a name is untouched, because the same number arrives
/// spelled differently across backups and the first spelling is as good as
/// the second, and a name the person typed or loaded is theirs.
///
/// A contact in the Trash is the one exception to reuse. ADR-0013: a backup
/// that still holds someone the person set aside is the person saying they
/// still talk to them, so the import makes a fresh contact from the backup,
/// as a first import would, and moves this handle and its siblings on the
/// trashed contact (the same number on another service) to it. It then
/// discards the trashed contact: each handle that contact still held leaves
/// it the one way a handle leaves a contact, so one in a conversation goes to
/// a new contact with no name and is Unknown until the backup, or the person,
/// says who it is.
///
/// Whatever the run does to the contact is recorded against `import_id`
/// (`db::import_contacts`), so the run can say afterwards which contacts it
/// created, named, or gave a handle, and why.
