//! The Assets and Previews on disk, and the code that removes them.
//!
//! An account's files sit under `data_dir/<account>/`, in one set of
//! folders for all of the account's sources, so one file imported from two
//! sources is stored once:
//!
//! - `<assets_dir>/<aa>/<sha256><ext>` is an original, named by its
//!   SHA-256 and sharded by the fingerprint's first two characters.
//! - `<assets_dir>/<aa>/.<sha256>.mime` is the MIME sidecar beside an
//!   original whose name carries no type.
//! - `<assets_dir>/.incoming/` holds uploads in progress: `{sha256}-*.part`
//!   files and multipart folders `{sha256}/{upload_id}/`.
//! - `<assets_converted_dir>/<aa>/<sha256><ext>` is a Preview.
//!
//! An Asset is unused when no attachment row of the account, from any
//! source, promoted or in staging, names it. That test alone is not enough
//! while the account has a running Import Run: `HEAD /v1/assets/{sha256}`
//! may have told the run a file exists, or the run may have uploaded it,
//! and the batch that names it has not arrived yet. So an original is
//! removed only while a connection holds the database write lock and no run
//! is running. Starting a run writes its row, so no run can start between
//! that check and the last removal. While a run is running the original
//! stays, and [`sweep_unreferenced`] removes it when the run ends. A
//! Preview is never kept for a run, because an import never names one: the
//! server makes Previews from originals after the fact.
//!
//! A removal that fails is logged and the rest go on. The database rows are
//! the record, so a request answers for what the database did, and a file
//! left behind is the sweep's to try again.
//!
//! Each remover has its own case:
//!
//! - [`remove_unreferenced`]: the Assets one delete left unnamed.
//! - [`remove_all_attachment_files`]: every Asset of an account whose
//!   messages were all deleted.
//! - [`remove_account_dir`]: everything of an account whose row is gone. No
//!   run can belong to a missing account, so it needs no run check.
//! - [`sweep_unreferenced`]: every unnamed Asset of an account, when a run
//!   ends.
//! - [`sweep_incoming`]: abandoned upload temps, by age.
//! - [`sweep_shard_temps`]: temporary files a killed write left in the
//!   shard folders, by age.
//!
//! Upload and `process-assets` still remove their own temporary and
//! replaced files. Those are never an Asset a row names.
