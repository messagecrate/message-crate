//! The one check that keeps an attachment's recorded path under its directory.
//!
//! Every attachment in a [`ConversationDocument`](crate::ConversationDocument)
//! carries a path relative to the export directory. That path is input: a
//! crafted CSV or JSON Lines file can name `/etc/passwd` or `../secrets`, and
//! whichever code joins it onto a directory — the format writers embedding bytes
//! into an EML, the transcode pass, the server's import — would read outside
//! the directory. The check lives here, once, so every caller refuses the same
//! shapes with the same message.
