//! Writing a file so that a power loss leaves either the old file or the
//! whole new one under its name, never an empty or cut-off one.
//!
//! A conversation file vouches for the attachment files it names: a resumed
//! Extract skips a conversation whose file is complete, and the Upload sends
//! the attachments that file points at. That holds only when every file is
//! on disk before anything that points at it. On a file system with delayed
//! allocation (ext4, for one) a rename can reach the disk ahead of the data
//! behind it, so each file is synced before it is renamed into place, and
//! the directory is synced after, so the rename itself is on disk before the
//! caller writes the next file that relies on it.
