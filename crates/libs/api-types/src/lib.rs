//! The response shapes the server's HTTP API sends, defined once for the
//! server that writes them and the client crates that read them.
//!
//! Two crates sit on either side of these shapes: `message-crate-server`
//! serializes them, and `message-crate-pull` deserializes them on its way to
//! `message-ir`. While each kept its own struct, the two could disagree
//! silently and did, three times: `message-crate-pull` declared a
//! participant's address a `String` after the server started sending `null`
//! for a participant a backup named without an address, kept
//! `#[serde(default)]` on a field the server had removed, and read a
//! `service` off the conversation the server has never sent there. Each of
//! those was a pull that failed at runtime, or quietly produced worse data,
//! with nothing in either crate's tests to catch it — `message-crate-pull`'s
//! "real export page" was a JSON literal it wrote itself, so it agreed with
//! whatever the mirror said.
//!
//! One definition makes the compiler the check. A field the server renames
//! stops compiling in the client, which is the whole point of putting the
//! shape here.
//!
//! The server sends every field of these shapes, as `null` when it has no
//! value, and never leaves one out (`docs/architecture/http-api.md`,
//! "Fields"), so none carries `#[serde(skip_serializing_if = ...)]`. The one
//! exception is [`Problem`], whose members follow RFC 7807: `detail` is a
//! string when it is there, and each extension member belongs to the problem
//! types that carry it.
//!
//! The `schema` feature adds `utoipa::ToSchema`, so the same structs describe
//! themselves in the OpenAPI document. The server turns it on; a client crate
//! leaves it off and never builds utoipa.
