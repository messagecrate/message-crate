//! Convert or compress a staged folder, patching the conversation files it wrote.
//!
//! This runs after the staging folder is complete and before anything is
//! uploaded, so the import can stop and ask between the two. It commits one
//! attachment at a time through a rename, which is what makes it resumable
//! with no progress record: a file under its final derivative name is fully
//! patched, and an original still on disk means work remains.
//!
//! ## Naming and resume
//!
//! The final name for a converted attachment is `{original_stem}-mv.{target_ext}`
//! — never the bare name [`media::derivative_name`] returns. A same-format
//! compress (`photo.jpg` → `photo.jpg`) or a video in either mode
//! (`clip.mp4` → `clip.mp4`) would otherwise produce a final name equal to
//! the source's own name, or equal to an already-committed derivative's own
//! name on a later resume — both break the "an original on disk means work
//! remains" invariant this pass depends on for resume. The `-mv` suffix
//! cannot collide with a staged original's own name: staged names come from
//! `attachment_dest_name` (`{utc-date}-{digest16}{ext}`), whose stem is
//! hex, and hex digits never include `m` or `v`.
//!
//! An attachment is pending when its recorded path exists on disk,
//! [`media::derivative_name`] returns `Some` for that file, and the file's
//! stem does not end in `-mv` (a `-mv` stem marks an already-committed
//! derivative, which must never re-enter the pending list — for a video, or
//! a compressed same-format file, `derivative_name` would otherwise call it
//! pending forever and re-degrade it on every resume).
//!
//! When the recorded path's stem ends in `-mv` but the file is *not* on
//! disk, the previous run crashed between patching the conversation file and
//! renaming the derivative into place. The original is still there under its
//! old name, so the pass heals: it strips the `-mv` suffix and looks under
//! `attachments/` for a file with that stem (any extension) that
//! `derivative_name` still wants, and re-transcodes it — the recorded
//! digest/size/path are stale regardless (decision 29), so a heal re-patches
//! exactly like a fresh conversion. When no such file exists but another
//! attachment sharing the original dropped it for size, the note it left
//! (see Aliasing) makes the attachment record `too_large` with the size.
//! When neither exists, the attachment is unrecoverable and is marked
//! `file_missing`.
//!
//! ## Aliasing
//!
//! Staged names are content-addressed (`attachment_dest_name`), and both
//! writers are idempotent by name, so two attachments — in the same document
//! or in different ones — can legitimately record the identical `path` when
//! they carry the same bytes. Every patch here therefore applies to *every*
//! attachment recorded at a given path, not just the one that happened to be
//! scanned first, and a recorded path that has gone missing without a `-mv`
//! stem is checked against its would-be derivative before being written off:
//! another attachment (in this document or another) may already have
//! transcoded and deleted the shared original, in which case this one is
//! repointed at the existing derivative rather than failing or re-encoding.
//!
//! A shared original whose derivative comes out over the size limit is
//! deleted together with the derivative (decision 45), so a later attachment
//! recording the same path finds neither. Before deleting, the pass writes a
//! note beside the original's name, `{original_name}.too_large`, holding the
//! derivative's size. A recorded path that is gone, has no committed
//! derivative, and has that note records `too_large` with the size, in this
//! run or a resumed one. Only a path with none of the three records
//! `file_missing`.
//!
//! ## Tool availability and failure
//!
//! ffmpeg/ffprobe are probed once, before any document is touched — parity
//! with `media::process_attachment_files`. A missing pair fails the whole
//! pass; it must never brand every attachment `convert_failed: ffmpeg not
//! found`. An attachment ffmpeg genuinely fails on, by contrast, is an
//! item-level issue: `missing_reason` gets `convert_failed: <detail>` and the
//! original — still on disk, untouched — keeps its `path` and
//! `digest_sha256` so a resume retries it rather than treating a transient
//! failure as permanent loss.
