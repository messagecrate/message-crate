//! Recompute what a staged directory holds, for the reviews.
//!
//! Everything here is measured from the directory. The one estimate is what the
//! Media stage will do to a file's size, and it is labelled as an estimate all
//! the way to the screen.
//!
//! This is always recomputed from the directory, never read back
//! from a previously-written `summary_json` — the directory is the truth, and
//! that is what makes resuming at a Review work: reopening the Import Run
//! recomputes rather than restoring.
//!
//! Contact matching is not done here — the server answers which identifiers
//! it already knows, and this returns the distinct identifiers found on
//! disk for the caller to ask about.
//!
//! ## Aliasing
//!
//! Staged names are content-addressed, so two attachment records — in the
//! same document or different ones — can legitimately share one physical
//! file (see `transcode.rs`'s module docs for why). `attachments` counts
//! every reference, because that is what the documents actually contain, but
//! `attachment_bytes` and `forecasts` are per physical
//! file: the first reference to a given recorded path is measured and
//! classified, and every later reference at that same path is folded into
//! the `attachments` count alone. Mirrors `pending_in`'s dedup in
//! `transcode.rs`, which faces the identical fact about the directory.
