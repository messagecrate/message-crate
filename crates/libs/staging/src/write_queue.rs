//! Drain a queue of conversations onto disk, one conversation at a time.
//!
//! Parse finishes before anything is written: every exporter buffers its
//! documents and collects attachment sources in one pass, then hands the
//! result here as a queue of [`ConversationUnit`]s. A worker writes a unit's
//! attachments first and its conversation file last, so a conversation file
//! on disk means everything it references is on disk too. That invariant is
//! what makes an interrupted write resumable: a resumed run skips any unit
//! whose conversation file it finds written to the end, and rewrites one
//! whose file is empty or cut off.
//!
//! Writers never transcode. Convert and compress stage the originals here and
//! run afterwards as their own resumable pass.
//!
//! Only non-obfuscated JSONL exports are routed here. Obfuscation is stateful
//! across documents and the other formats merge or embed at finish, so those
//! keep the `FormatSink` path.
