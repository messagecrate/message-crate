//! Staging: the resumable path that writes a run's conversations and
//! attachments into the Staging Directory.
//!
//! Parse finishes before anything is written; an exporter hands its
//! documents to [`ExportWriter`], which either drains the bounded write
//! queue (JSON Lines, the import path: a conversation file lands only after
//! everything it references, so an interrupted run resumes by skipping what
//! is already there) or stages attachments and writes through
//! `message_ir_format::FormatSink` for every other format. An exporter whose
//! attachments arrive as bytes writes each payload to the writer's
//! [`AttachmentSpool`], under the app's cache folder, as it parses, so parse
//! never holds the backup's attachments in memory, and the write reads them
//! back a file at a time. Every write is checked for room first, against
//! the disk that holds it ([`check_headroom`]).
//! The transcode pass ([`transcode_staged`]) converts or compresses staged
//! attachments afterwards as its own resumable pass, and
//! [`summarize_staging`] reads a staging folder back for the Staging Review.
//! Both work to the media settings Staging recorded in the folder
//! ([`write_media_settings`], [`read_media_settings`]).
//!
//! Formats live in `message-ir-format`; the run model in
//! `message-crate-core`. Why this is its own crate:
//! `docs/adr/0012-four-crates-in-the-export-pipeline.md`.
