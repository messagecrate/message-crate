# message-ir-format

Writes a `ConversationDocument` to JSON, JSON Lines, CSV, EML, or MBOX. A format that folds every conversation into one file is written through a `MergedArchive` the caller supplies. Obfuscation runs here when finishing an export. Media convert/compress runs before that, in the staging step. Readers exist for every format so a directory can be converted later.

Exporters and `message-reexport` use this crate. The desktop app's Export screen and the Convert tab in Settings use it through `message-reexport`.
