# message-crate-http

Blocking HTTP client helpers and typed retry classification for the crates that
talk to a Message Crate server. Calls block so they can run on worker threads
without an async runtime.

One `HttpSession` carries the connection pool; `auth_check` performs the login
probe; `ok_json` reads every server answer, turning a failure into the `detail`
sentence of the server's RFC 7807 problem document rather than a status code;
and `classify_retry` decides which failures are worth trying again.

`message-crate-import` and `message-crate-export` use this crate, and the desktop app reaches
`AuthError` through their re-exports.
