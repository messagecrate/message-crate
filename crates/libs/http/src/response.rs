//! Reading the server's answer: the value on success, the server's own sentence
//! on failure.
//!
//! Every route the server serves answers a failure with an RFC 7807 problem
//! document (`docs/architecture/http-api.md`), and its `detail` is written for the person to read.
//! Both client crates were reading it themselves — `message-crate-import` with an
//! `ok_json` helper, `message-crate-export` with an `error_sentence` one — over two
//! private copies of the same struct. One copy of the reading lives here, over
//! the shared [`Problem`] type, so a change to the server's failure shape is
//! one edit rather than a hunt.
