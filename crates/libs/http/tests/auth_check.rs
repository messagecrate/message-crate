//! `auth_check` is the desktop app's login, and every branch in it produces a
//! different message for the person typing the URL: "that is the wrong host",
//! "that session is not valid", "the server is rate limiting you". Nothing exercised
//! the function itself before — the unit tests reach the classifiers directly,
//! so the wiring between the response and the classifier was untested, and a
//! change that answered `unauthorized` to every failure would have passed them
//! all. These drive the real function over HTTP against a local mock.
