//! Upload a folder of conversation files into Message Crate.
//!
//! # What this module does
//!
//! An export folder has one `.jsonl` file per conversation, plus an
//! `attachments/` folder of media files. A push:
//!
//! 1. Logs in to the server with the session token.
//! 2. For each conversation file, finds attachments, uploads any the server
//!    does not already have, then sends the messages in batches.
//! 3. Remembers progress in a journal file so a later run can skip work that
//!    already succeeded.
//!
//! # Why it is built this way (upload performance)
//!
//! - **Attachments first, then messages.** Messages point at attachments by a
//!   content fingerprint (sha256). The server must already have that file, or
//!   the import would fail. Media is uploaded before message text is sent.
//! - **Fingerprint = sha256.** Same bytes always produce the same hex string.
//!   The server stores one copy per fingerprint, so the same photo shared in
//!   many chats is uploaded once.
//! - **Prepare ahead.** Reading a chat and uploading its media can take a long
//!   time. While the main loop waits on a message-import HTTP request, other
//!   threads can already prepare the next few conversations
//!   ([`crate::prepare`]). That hides disk and upload work behind network wait.
//! - **Several attachment uploads at once.** Small files are slow if sent one
//!   after another (network round trips dominate). Workers upload several at
//!   the same time.
//! - **One message-import request at a time.** Imports update shared database
//!   state; running many imports in parallel is harder to reason about and
//!   can confuse the journal ([`crate::pipeline`]). Attachments stay parallel;
//!   message batches do not.
//! - **Size limits on each request.** Cloudflare (and similar proxies) reject
//!   huge single uploads. Message batches are split, and large attachments use
//!   multipart, so a big chat or video does not hit that wall.
