## About The Project

[![Docker][Docker]][Docker-url] [![React][React.js]][React-url] [![Rust][Rust-dev]][Rust-url] [![SQLite][SQLite]][SQLite-url] [![Tauri][Tauri]][Tauri-url] [![Vite][Vite]][Vite-url]

Message Crate copies your conversations out of chat apps and phone backups — iMessage, WhatsApp, Android SMS — and stores them in a self-hosted, searchable archive that you control. Read old threads in a browser, search years of messages, and export them as ordinary files whenever you like.

### Project Details

The Message Crate software has three parts:

- **Backend** - The core system that runs on your computer. It keeps you logged in, stores your messages, and powers the search feature.
- **Desktop App** - A program that imports your messages into Message Crate from phone backups and app exports. You can also view, organize, and export your messages from here.
- **Website** - The desktop app in a web browser, for reading, searching, and organizing your messages. Importing, exporting, and converting need the desktop app.

You can bring in:

- Apple Messages from an iPhone backup, or from Messages on a Mac
- Android texts and picture messages from an SMS Backup & Restore file
- WhatsApp from an iPhone backup or from WhatsApp's Android files

A few older export formats still work if that is all you have left.

Once messages are imported you can:

- Read threads the way you would in an app or on a phone, including group chats. Photos, videos, and other attachments are included.
- Search across years of conversations
- Save a copy back out as ordinary files if you want a directory on disk
- Combine texts from more than one phone or app into one archive

## Who The Project Is For

This project is for people who want a personal copy of their phone messages. That includes anyone replacing a phone, leaving a chat app, or keeping a long-term archive of texts.

## Getting Started

Follow the [User Guide](https://messagecrate.app/docs/user/try/what-is-message-crate/) to run the demo and import your own data.

The [Developer Guide](https://messagecrate.app/docs/developer/) covers setting up a local development environment and compiling from source.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. The [Contributing guide](https://messagecrate.app/docs/developer/contributing/) covers the development environment, running the code, and how pull requests work.

## Additional documentation
