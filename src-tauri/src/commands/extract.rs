//! `extract` and `cancel` commands.
//!
//! `extract` starts the selected exporter on a background thread and returns
//! immediately. Progress is sent back as Tauri events:
//! `extract:log` (one human-readable log line), `extract:progress` (one
//! typed [`ExtractProgressEvent`], mapped from the exporter's
//! `ProgressEvent`), `extract:issue` (one row for the Import Run's record,
//! sent the moment the exporter records it), `extract:finished` (a summary
//! string or JSON object), and `extract:error` ([`ExtractErrorEvent`]).
//!
//! `cancel` sets the cancel flag of the job that is running (see
//! `commands::jobs`). The exporter checks it between steps through
//! `ExporterConfig.cancel`.
