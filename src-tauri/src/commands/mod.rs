//! Commands the Vite UI calls through Tauri's `invoke`.
//!
//! Each `#[tauri::command]` function runs in this desktop process, not in the
//! WebView. That is how the UI starts exporters, finds ffmpeg, and reads the
//! user's home directory. Native file dialogs come from the dialog plugin
//! registered in `main.rs`.
//!
//! Long jobs return as soon as the background thread starts. Progress, log
//! lines, issues, each conversation an Upload finished, and errors are sent
//! as Tauri events (`extract:log`, `extract:progress`, `extract:issue`,
//! `extract:file-done`, `extract:finished`, `extract:error`).
