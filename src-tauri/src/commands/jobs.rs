//! Shared scaffolding for the background job commands (`extract`, `format`,
//! `pull`, `upload`, `transcode_staging`).
//!
//! One job runs at a time in this process. Every job reports on the same
//! `extract:*` events, which do not say which job sent them, so a second job
//! would end the first one's wait in the web app with its own finished event.
//! A job command therefore starts its job with [`start_job`], which refuses
//! while another job runs and names that job. The job gets a cancel flag of
//! its own, and [`cancel_running_job`] sets the flag of the job that is
//! running, so a Cancel stops that job and never one started after it.
//!
//! [`spawn_job`] runs the job on a worker thread, ends it, and only then sends
//! its `extract:finished` or `extract:error` event: the web app starts the
//! next stage's job as soon as that event arrives, and the job must have
//! ended by then or the next one would be refused. What differs per command
//! (building the config, mapping progress events, and shaping the finished
//! summary) stays in the command.
