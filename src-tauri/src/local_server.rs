//! The Message Crate this app starts for itself.
//!
//! The installer carries `message-crate-server` beside the app, the way it
//! carries the Apple Messages helper. When the app is pointed at its own
//! address, [`OWN_ADDRESS`], it first asks that address what it is:
//!
//! - a Message Crate answers (Docker on this computer, or a server left
//!   running): the app uses it and starts nothing;
//! - nothing answers: the app starts the server and waits for it to listen;
//! - something else answers: the port is taken, and the app says so.
//!
//! The server is given its Data Directory, its address and the website files on
//! its command line, so there is no config file. A database that does not
//! exist yet is created with the Demo Account before the server listens,
//! which is why a first start takes a few seconds longer.
//!
//! The server listens on this computer only, unless the person switched on
//! the setting that opens it to the network; it then listens on every
//! address of this computer, on the same port. Changing the setting restarts
//! the server the app started, at once while it is starting and once no
//! desktop job runs when it is ready. A Message Crate the app only found is
//! not changed, and the setting never starts a server.
//!
//! The app stops the server it started when it closes, and never one it only
//! found. The process is killed, not asked: the server's database survives
//! that, and the only work a kill can interrupt is an import this app was
//! running anyway.
//!
//! What happens next is decided by one pure function, [`step`], from the
//! state the app has, the network setting the person wants, and what just
//! happened. [`LocalServer`] holds that state with the processes and does
//! what [`step`] asks.
