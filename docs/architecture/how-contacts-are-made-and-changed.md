# How contacts are made and changed

Two things write contacts and identities in bulk: an import of a backup, and
an address book load. They write to the same tables under different rules.
This document follows each one step by step and then sets them side by side.

The words and the relationships are in
[Contacts, identities and messages](contacts-identities-and-messages.md),
which also holds the reason for each rule. This document is the data flow.

The intended order is import first, then the address book. An import brings
the people in, many of them with no name. The person exports the address
book, names the Unknowns in a spreadsheet, and loads the file back.

In every diagram a six-sided box is a refusal.

## An import of a backup

The code is `crates/server/server/src/imports_api/contact_name.rs`. The rules
are the same for every source: an iPhone backup, an Android SMS backup, or
WhatsApp.

An import only adds. It never moves an identity from one contact to another,
never removes an identity or a Contact Group membership, and never deletes a
contact outside the Trash.

Every identity a conversation or a message uses is on a contact. An
identity leaves a contact one way, `contacts::move_identity` in
`crates/server/server/src/db/contacts.rs`: to the contact it is given, or off.
One taken off that a conversation or a message uses goes to a new contact
with no name, so the person is Unknown again. One nothing uses is deleted.

### A person the backup gives an address for

An import meets a person three ways: as a participant of a conversation, as
the other side of a one-to-one conversation, or as the sender of a message.
A sender counts even when no conversation names them. The account holder is
never one of these people.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["A person with an address"] --> B["Find the identity by its key, or create it with origin import"]
  B --> C{"Is the identity on a contact?"}
  C -- yes --> E{"Is that contact in the Trash?"}
  C -- no --> D{"Is the same number on the other service on a contact?"}
  D -- yes --> D1["The identity joins that contact"]
  D1 --> E
  D -- no --> N["New contact with origin import, holding this identity. It takes the backup's name, or no name."]
  E -- yes --> T["A new contact is made from the backup, holding this identity and the same number on the other service. The trashed contact is discarded. Each other identity it had that a conversation uses goes to a new contact with no name; one nothing uses is deleted."]
  E -- no --> F{"Does the backup give a name, and is the contact nameless and made by an import?"}
  F -- yes --> F1["The contact takes the backup's name"]
  F -- no --> F2["The contact is left as it is"]
```

- A phone number has one key. A number with `+` keeps its country. A number
  without `+` is read as a US number when it has ten digits, or eleven
  starting with `1`.
- iMessage, SMS, MMS and RCS are all text messages, so one number is one
  identity with the service `phone`. The same number on WhatsApp is a second
  identity with the service `whatsapp`.
- An import names a contact only when the contact has no name and an import
  made it. A name a person typed, or a name a load set, survives every later
  import.
- A phone number the import cannot key with confidence is stored and flagged
  for review. It does not stop the import.

### A person the backup names with no address

A participant or a sender the backup names with no address gets an identity
of type `other` whose value is the name, on the conversation's service. From
there it is a person with an address, above: the identity finds its contact,
or a new contact takes the name. Nothing is looked up by name.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["A participant or sender with no address"] --> B{"Does the backup give a name?"}
  B -- no --> B1["Nothing is created"]
  B -- yes --> C["The identity of type other holding the name, on this service"]
  C --> D["As a person with an address, above"]
```

- Two people one service names alike, with no address for either, share the
  identity, and so the contact.
- The name on WhatsApp and the name in text messages are two identities, one
  on each service, and join one contact as the same number does.
- A contact whose only identities are of type `other` is Unknown, whatever
  its name.
- Each identity of type `other` is a person the exporter could not tie to an
  address, so the import is incomplete. The run counts the ones it met
  (`other_identities`).

### What gets no contact

A group conversation's own id, such as `chat1000000005`, is stored on the
conversation so the group is recognised next time. It is nobody's identity
and gets no contact. The same holds for the `orphaned` conversation.

### When the run finishes

The Import Run makes one Contact Group named `<source> import <date>`. It
holds every contact the run created, named, gave an identity, or replaced
from the Trash. The membership is a snapshot and does not change later.

## An address book load

The code is `plan` and `apply` in
`crates/server/server/src/db/address_book.rs`.

The file has one row per identity and six columns: `contact_id`,
`display_name`, `groups`, `service`, `identity_type`, `identity`. A load runs
in Append mode, the default, or in Edit mode.

### A cell a spreadsheet would run

A spreadsheet reads a cell that starts with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, a tab or a
carriage return as a formula, and runs it.
A name can come from a backup, and on WhatsApp the other person chooses their
own, so Export writes a `'` before every such cell, in every column.
A contact named `=HYPERLINK(…)` is written `'=HYPERLINK(…)`, and a phone
number `+6595550100` is written `'+6595550100`.
CSV quoting does not prevent this, because a spreadsheet removes the quotes
and then reads the cell as typed.
The code is `written_cell` and `read_cell` in the same file.

The load takes off one `'` that comes before one of those characters, in any
column.
A spreadsheet can keep that `'` when it saves the file or drop it, and both
load the same, so a file loaded straight back changes nothing.
A cell that already starts with `'` and then one of those characters, such
as the name `'=1+1`, is written with one more `'` so that it loads back as it
was.
A `'` before any other text is part of the cell.

### 1. The whole load

Every row is checked before anything is written. Every broken rule is
collected, so one refusal names every bad row. The writes are one
transaction. A row with every cell blank is skipped.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["Read the CSV"] --> B{"All six column headers present, and every row readable as CSV?"}
  B -- no --> R{{"Refused"}}
  B -- yes --> C["Gather rows into contacts by contact_id (step 2)"]
  C --> D["Check names, groups and identities of every row (steps 3 to 5)"]
  D --> E{"Any rule broken?"}
  E -- yes --> R2{{"Refused whole. Every bad row listed. Nothing written."}}
  E -- no --> F["For each contact in the file: set the name, place its identities, set its Contact Groups"]
  F --> G{"Mode"}
  G -- Append --> I
  G -- Edit --> H["Take identities off each file contact that its rows do not list (step 6)"]
  H --> I["Delete contacts left with no name and no identity"]
  I --> K["Commit and report the seven counts and the notes"]
```

### 2. Which contact a row speaks for

A `contact_id` is known only when it is a whole number and is the id of a
contact in Contacts. The id of a contact in the Trash is not known. It is
treated like any other text and makes a new contact.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["contact_id cell of a row"] --> B{"Blank?"}
  B -- yes --> N["A new contact made from this one row. Two blank rows are two contacts."]
  B -- no --> C{"The id of a contact in Contacts?"}
  C -- yes --> K["That existing contact. Every row with this id belongs to it."]
  C -- no --> T["A new contact. Every row with this same text belongs to it."]
```

### 3. The name

The rows of one contact must give the same `display_name` or leave it blank.
A loaded name replaces the name of an existing contact whenever it differs,
whatever set the old name: an import, an earlier load, or a person typing.
A rename by a load does not change the contact's `origin`. A contact a load
creates has the origin `address_book`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["display_name cells of one contact's rows"] --> B{"Do the filled cells all hold the same name?"}
  B -- no --> R{{"Refused: names the two rows that disagree"}}
  B -- yes --> C{"Existing contact or new?"}
  C -- existing --> D{"Is the name blank on every row?"}
  D -- yes --> D1["Name left as it is"]
  D -- no --> E{"Same as the name the contact has now?"}
  E -- yes --> E1["Nothing changes"]
  E -- no --> E2["Contact renamed. Counts as contacts_updated."]
  C -- new --> F{"No name and no identity on any row?"}
  F -- yes --> R2{{"Refused: a new contact needs a display_name or an identity"}}
  F -- no --> G["Contact created with the name, or with no name. Counts as contacts_created."]
```

A contact name is stored without the whitespace at its start and end, on
every path that writes one: an import, a load, and a person typing.
Whitespace here is every character Unicode marks as White_Space, which is
what Rust's `str::trim` removes: spaces, tabs, line breaks and no-break
spaces among them.
So the name cell `'` then a tab then `Tab` creates a contact named `Tab`, and
a file loaded straight back renames nobody, because the name it compares
against was trimmed the same way.
A query reads and compares a stored name as it is, without trimming it again.
The code is `create_contact` and `propose_name` in
`crates/server/server/src/db/contacts.rs`.

### 4. Each identity: is the row valid?

A row that leaves `service`, `identity_type` and `identity` all blank lists no
identity. That is how a contact with no identity is written.

An identity written exactly as Message Crate already keys it is accepted as
it stands, so an exported file always loads back.

A phone number written without `+` that matches no key as written may be one
whose `+` a spreadsheet dropped.
Export writes `'+6595550100`, and a spreadsheet that drops the `'` can save
that cell as the number `6595550100`.
So the load first asks whether the contact the row names already holds `+`
followed by the value's digits.
If it does, the row names that identity.
Only the row's own contact is looked at, so a dropped `+` never attaches
another person's number to this contact.
A contact that holds both readings, such as `+6595550100` and
`+16595550100`, refuses the load, naming both keys, because the row cannot
say which it means.
Otherwise the value is keyed by the phone rule: ten digits as a US number,
eleven starting with `1` likewise, and any other count as bare digits.
A ten-digit US number written without `+`, whose `+1` key the account holds,
therefore still loads as that identity.

A person editing in a spreadsheet does not see the `+` go, so the load says
what it did.
Its `notes` name each row it read with the `+` back, and each value without
`+` that became a new identity.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A{"service, identity_type and identity all blank?"} -- yes --> A1["Row lists no identity"]
  A -- no --> B{"service is phone or whatsapp?"}
  B -- no --> R1{{"Refused: unknown service"}}
  B -- yes --> C{"identity_type is phone, email, username or other?"}
  C -- no --> R2{{"Refused: unknown identity_type"}}
  C -- yes --> D{"identity blank?"}
  D -- yes --> R3{{"Refused: identity is blank"}}
  D -- no --> E{"Written exactly as an identity Message Crate already holds?"}
  E -- yes --> K["Key is the text as written"]
  E -- no --> F{"identity_type"}
  F -- phone --> G{"4 to 15 digits, and only digits, spaces and + - ( ) . ?"}
  G -- no --> R4{{"Refused: not a phone number"}}
  G -- yes --> P{"Written with + ?"}
  P -- yes --> G1["Key is the normalized phone number"]
  P -- no --> Q{"Does the row's contact hold + and its digits?"}
  Q -- no --> G2["Key is the normalized phone number. A note if no identity has that key yet."]
  Q -- yes --> S{"Does it also hold the normalized key?"}
  S -- yes --> R6{{"Refused: names both keys"}}
  S -- no --> G3["Key is + and its digits. A note says so."]
  F -- email --> H{"One @ with text on both sides, no spaces?"}
  H -- no --> R5{{"Refused: not an email address"}}
  H -- yes --> H1["Key is the address in lower case"]
  F -- "username or other" --> I1["Key is the text as written"]
```

### 5. Each identity: who gets it?

An identity belongs to one contact. It moves to the file's contact freely
when its current holder has no name, or when the holder is also in the file.
Taking an identity from a named contact the file does not mention refuses
the load.
The refusal names the row, the identity, and both contacts, and says how to
let the identity move.

Can the holder be added to the file?

Only when it is in Contacts.
A holder in the Trash can't be, because its id reads as unknown text and
makes a new contact (step 2).
For a holder in the Trash, the refusal says so, and says to restore it and
add it to the file, or to delete it for good first.

A load takes only the identity the row lists. The same number on the other
service stays where it is, with the contact that holds it, unless a row
lists it too, and a file that lists the two under different contacts puts
each where its row says. A load applies exactly what the file says and
never second-guesses it, so an import's rule that one number is one person on
every service does not apply here (see
[Contacts, identities and messages](contacts-identities-and-messages.md)).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["A valid identity under a contact"] --> B{"Already listed earlier in this file?"}
  B -- "yes, under another contact" --> R1{{"Refused: an identity belongs to one contact"}}
  B -- "yes, under this contact" --> B1["Counted once"]
  B -- no --> C{"Does Message Crate already hold this identity?"}
  C -- no --> C1["Identity created with origin address_book and put on the contact. Counts as identities_added."]
  C -- yes --> D{"Who holds it now?"}
  D -- nobody --> D1["Put on the contact. Counts as identities_added."]
  D -- "this contact" --> D2["Nothing changes"]
  D -- "another contact" --> E{"Holder has no name, or holder is in the file?"}
  E -- no --> F{"Holder in the Trash?"}
  F -- no --> R2{{"Refused: names the row, the identity and both contacts, and says to add the holder to the file"}}
  F -- yes --> R3{{"Refused: names the row, the identity and both contacts, and says to restore the holder and add it to the file, or delete it for good"}}
  E -- yes --> E1["Moved to this contact. Counts as identities_moved."]
```

### 6. Contact Groups, and what Edit removes

The rows of one contact must list the same Contact Groups, in any order and
any letter case, or leave the cell blank. Names are separated by `;`. A name
Message Crate would not let a person create refuses the load. A name that
matches no Contact Group, ignoring letter case, creates one.

A Contact Group's name can't hold `;`, because the `groups` cell separates
names with it. Creating or renaming a Contact Group to such a name is
refused. The cell is therefore never escaped: the address book is meant to be
edited by hand in a spreadsheet, and an escape such as `\;` would be a trap
there. An export loaded straight back lists the same Contact Groups.
Message Tags are not in the address book and may hold `;`.

Append only adds. Edit makes each contact in the file hold exactly the
identities and memberships its rows list, so a row for a number's
text-message identity does not keep its WhatsApp identity on the contact:
with no row of its own, that one comes off too. In Edit, a contact whose `groups`
cell is blank on every row loses all its memberships.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["For each contact in the file"] --> B["Add the memberships its rows list, creating missing Contact Groups"]
  B --> M{"Mode"}
  M -- Append --> Z["Other memberships and identities stay"]
  M -- Edit --> C["Remove memberships its rows do not list"]
  C --> D["After every contact is placed: take off each identity the contact holds that its rows do not list. Counts as identities_removed."]
  D --> D1["One a conversation, message or reaction uses goes to a new contact with no name. One nothing uses is deleted."]
  Z --> E
  D1 --> E{"Did any contact lose an identity, by a move or a removal?"}
  E -- no --> G
  E -- yes --> F{"Does it now have no name and no identity?"}
  F -- yes --> F1["Contact deleted, even one the file does not list. Counts as contacts_deleted."]
  F -- no --> G
  F1 --> G["Done"]
```

### What a load leaves alone

- A contact the file does not list, in both modes. The one exception is a
  nameless contact that gives up an identity to a file contact. It is
  deleted if that leaves it empty.
- Identities and memberships of a file contact that its rows do not list, in
  Append mode.
- Contacts in the Trash. The file cannot speak for one. A nameless one can
  still give up an identity.

### The seven counts

| Count | What it counts |
|---|---|
| `contacts_created` | Contacts the load created |
| `contacts_updated` | Contacts in the file that were renamed, or whose identities or memberships changed |
| `contacts_deleted` | Contacts left with neither a name nor an identity |
| `identities_added` | Identities put on a contact that no contact held before |
| `identities_moved` | Identities taken from one contact and given to another |
| `identities_removed` | Identities taken off a contact. Edit only |
| `groups_created` | Contact Groups the load created |

Beside the counts, `notes` holds one sentence for each phone number written
without `+` that the load read with its `+` back, or that became a new
identity (step 4). Each sentence starts with its row number.

## The two side by side

| | Import of a backup | Address book load |
|---|---|---|
| What starts it | Each person the backup's messages meet: a participant, the other side of a one-to-one conversation, or a sender | Each row of the CSV |
| New contact | One for every address no contact holds, named if the backup gives a name, otherwise nameless | One for a blank or unrecognised `contact_id`. It needs a name or an identity |
| Naming an existing contact | Only when the contact has no name and an import made it | Whenever the file's name differs, whatever set the old one |
| Same number on the other service | Joins the contact that already holds the other one | Stays where it is. Only a row for it moves it, so a file can split a number |
| Identity already on another contact | Never moved. The import uses that contact | Moved if the holder is nameless or in the file. Otherwise the load is refused |
| Removing things | Never removes an identity, a membership, or a contact outside the Trash | Edit removes unlisted identities and memberships. An emptied nameless contact is deleted |
| Contact in the Trash | Discarded and made new from the backup. Its other identities in conversations go to new contacts with no name | Cannot be addressed. Its id is treated as unknown text |
| Person named with no address | An identity of type `other` holding the name, on the conversation's service, and its contact | A row with a name and blank identity columns makes a contact with no identity, and never matches by name |
| Contact Groups | One group per Import Run, holding the contacts the run touched | The groups the `groups` column lists |
| Bad data | No refusal for contact reasons. An odd phone number is stored and flagged | Any broken rule refuses the whole file |
| `origin` written | `import` | `address_book` |

## What follows from the differences

- **A typed or loaded name survives every later import.** An import cannot
  rename a contact that has a name.
- **A load can rename anything.** It replaces a typed name as readily as an
  imported one.
- **Edit treats a blank `groups` cell as "no groups".** It does not mean
  "leave the memberships alone".
- **A load can split one number across two contacts.** It moves only the
  identities its rows list, so a row for a number on one service leaves the
  number on the other service where it is. An import never splits one.
- **A contact the file does not list can still be deleted.** A nameless
  contact that gives up its last identity to a file contact is removed.

## Open questions

These are what the code does today. None has been decided as a rule, and
each has an open issue.

- **Should a load replace a name a person typed?** (#1057) It does. Before the
  address book became Message Crate's own CSV, a load replaced only an
  imported name.
- **Should an import name a nameless contact a load made?** (#1058) It does
  not. The
  import's rule needs the contact to be both nameless and of origin
  `import`.
