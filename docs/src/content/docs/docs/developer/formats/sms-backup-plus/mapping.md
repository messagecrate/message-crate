title: "SMS Backup+ import mapping"
description: "How SMS Backup+ EML fields become the shared conversation structure."
---

How flat and archive `.eml` messages become shared `ConversationDocument` values, including identity resolution, deduplication, and retained source data.

Input layouts: [format](/docs/developer/formats/sms-backup-plus/format/). Shared model: [message-ir](/docs/developer/architecture/common-message/). CSV projection: [CSV columns](/docs/developer/reference/csv-columns/) and [`message_ir_format::CSV_HEADERS`](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/blob/main/crates/libs/ir-format/src/write.rs).

## Goal / non-goal

- **Goal:** Document how SMS Backup+ fields fill shared conversation fields and the retained source-data bag.
- **Non-goal:** Define EML source layouts or a private CSV schema. Source layout belongs in [format](/docs/developer/formats/sms-backup-plus/format/), and every output format is projected from the shared model.

## Pipeline / output

Source EML → `ConversationDocument` → [`message_ir_format::FormatSink`](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/blob/main/crates/libs/ir-format/src/format_sink.rs) ).

The desktop app's Import screen always writes JSON Lines, one file per conversation, because Import and Push read conversation files in that form. Every other format (JSON, CSV, EML, MBOX, SMS Backup & Restore XML) is a rewrite of that output through [Convert](/docs/developer/formats/convert/), which Export and **Settings → Convert** run.

In CSV form: one file per conversation (header + one row per message after dedupe). MIME attachments under `attachments/` when copying/embedding. Filenames: 1:1 → `+E164.csv`; untitled groups → `group_+A_+B_….csv` (max 10 phones, then a hash). A mail with no `X-smssync-address` is keyed by `name:` and the name in its subject, trimmed and otherwise unchanged, so "José" and "Josè" are two conversations. The prefix keeps a person named "AMAZON" apart from the sender `AMAZON`. With no address, a name written like a number ("+1 555 0101") is taken as a name too. Beside an address, such a name is that address and gives no name. A mail with neither an address nor a name belongs to the conversation that names nobody, keyed `nameless:`, with no participant. A file name is made from the key like any other, with a short suffix when two keys give the same file name. The XML form is a single SyncTech `smses.xml`.

## Source → shared fields

| Shared field | EML source |
|---------------|------------|
| `chat_identifier` | Peer's handle key (a number, an email address or a sender name, classified by `phone::Handle::parse`), `chat-group-…`, `name:` and the trimmed name in the subject when the mail records no address, or `nameless:` when it records neither |
| `conversation_type` | `group` when two or more other participants are named, else `individual`. A mail whose `To` names two or more addresses (in practice an MMS) takes its participants from `To`, plus `From` when it was received, leaving out the owner (a received one only when `To` names the owner); any other mail takes them from `X-smssync-address`. See the `From` / `To` row in [format](/docs/developer/formats/sms-backup-plus/format/) for why. A member named by email address is keyed by the number that address stands for. One-to-one mails that give an email address in `From` (received) or `To` (sent) and a single number in `X-smssync-address` say which. So the group's key does not change with the contact book at backup time. A group that then names one person twice is that person's one-to-one conversation. A member the archive gives no number for keeps the email address, and each one is counted once as `group_members_without_number` in the run summary. A member whose address the archive gives two or more numbers, as a contact card two people share does, also keeps the email address. Each one is counted once as `group_members_with_several_numbers`. One number written in national form in some mails and with its `+` country code in others counts as two numbers, because only a number written with `+` is read as international |
| `group_title` | Derived for groups (empty for 1:1) |
| `participants_json` | Peer identities for the conversation |
| `guid` | SHA-256 of the message identity (`MessageGuid`): chat id, direction, sender, UTC milliseconds, collapsed text, sorted attachment digests |
| `timestamp` / `timestamp_utc` / `timestamp_display` / `timestamp_unix_ms` | Flat: `X-smssync-date` / `Date`; archive: body timestamp |
| `direction` | `incoming` / `outgoing` from `X-smssync-type` or archive sender |
| `service` | Always `sms` |
| `sender_identity` / `sender_display_name` | Outgoing uses export owner. Incoming one-to-one: the other participant. Incoming group: the address inside `<…>` of `From` (the part before `@unknown.email`, or the whole email address) when it is one of the participants, else no sender. Each group message stored with no sender is counted as `group_messages_without_sender` in the run summary and listed as an issue in the Import Run, naming its EML file. An incoming mail whose `To` names a group but none of the owner's addresses: the address in `From`, else no sender (see `group_messages_owner_not_named` in [format](/docs/developer/formats/sms-backup-plus/format/)). Both counters count stored messages, after duplicates are dropped. The display name may come from Subject, except for a mail that does not name the owner, whose Subject names the `X-smssync-address` contact rather than its sender: filed under the sender in `From`, its display name is the display-name part of `From` (`"Carol" <carol@example.com>`), when it has one that is not written like a number |
| `text` | Every `text/plain` part, joined with a newline, in the order of the parts (the SMIL's order when the mail carries one) |
| `attachments_json` | Every other MIME part with content, a contact card (`text/x-vcard`) included, under `attachments/`. A part that cannot be decoded is dropped and counted as `skipped_unreadable_part` |
| `message_kind` | `sms` or `mms` |
| `export_source` / `export_tool` / `export_tool_version` | `sms-backup-plus` / `SMS Backup+` / `1.5.11` |
| `owner_identity` / `owner_display_name` | Export owner |
| `android_type` | Raw `X-smssync-type` when present |
| `source_fields_json` | Vendor bag (below) |

Apple-only columns stay empty.

## `source_fields_json`

| Bag key | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `smssync_id` | `X-smssync-id` when present |
| `eml_path` | Relative path to the source `.eml` |

## Deduplication

Every parsed mail is kept until the conversation is projected.
The shared dedupe step (`message_ir::one_copy_per_message`) then keeps one copy of each message.
Two copies are one message when the chat, the direction, the sender, the collapsed text and the attachment digests agree and the times are compatible.
Times are compatible when they are equal to the millisecond, or when one copy has whole seconds only and falls in the same second as the other.

A mail timed by `X-smssync-date` in milliseconds has milliseconds.
A mail timed by `Date`, or by `X-smssync-date` in seconds, has whole seconds only.
A whole-second copy yields to a millisecond copy, so the message keeps the millisecond time and one `guid` whichever file is read first.
Two millisecond copies with different times are two messages, such as the same text sent twice 300 ms apart.

`X-smssync-id` never decides whether two copies are one message, because one copy of a message can carry it and another lack it, and Android reuses the id after a wipe.
Between two copies nothing else tells apart, the one that carries `X-smssync-id` is kept, then the one whose `.eml` path sorts first.
Rows are sorted by time before writing.
