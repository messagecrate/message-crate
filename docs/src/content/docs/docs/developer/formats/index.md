description: "What each backup converter writes, where it falls short, and links to input-format and mapping pages."

These pages are Developer docs (the converter libraries and their field mapping; none has a command line, see [ADR 0001](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-no-command-line-except-the-server.md)). Day-to-day Import from a phone backup is in the [User Guide](/docs/user/features/messages/import/).

What each converter writes (and where it falls short). Marks: **yes** / **partial** / **no**.

## Shared model

All converters build a **common message** per conversation (`ConversationDocument`, schema version 8 in [`message-ir`](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/tree/main/crates/libs/ir)), then project the user-picked format via `FormatSink` in [`message-ir-format`](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/tree/main/crates/libs/ir-format) (default **JSON**). When packaging is CSV, columns follow [`CSV_HEADERS`](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/blob/main/crates/libs/ir-format/src/write.rs). Across the board:

- The peer is `chat_identifier` — there is **no** dedicated receiver-phone column
- Every participant is a **typed identity**: `identity_type` (`phone` / `email` / `username` / `other`) on each JSON/JSONL participant and inside `participants_json`; the CSV `identity_type` column carries the sender's type, inferred from the identity when the source doesn't supply it
- Direction is `direction` (`incoming` / `outgoing`) — there is **no** `is_from_me` column
- Outgoing rows fill `sender_identity` / `sender_display_name` from owner identity (`owner_identity` / `owner_display_name` columns)
- Vendor leftovers live in `source_fields_json` (not `xml_fields_json`)

## Capabilities

| | GO SMS Pro | SMS Backup & Restore | SMS Backup+ | OpenExtract | iMazing | WhatsApp | iMessage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Output** | Per-chat CSV / EML / MBOX / JSON(+L) / **XML** | Per-chat CSV / EML / MBOX / JSON(+L) / **XML** | Per-chat CSV / EML / MBOX / JSON(+L) / **XML** | Per-chat CSV / EML / MBOX / JSON(+L) / **XML** | Per-chat CSV / EML / MBOX / JSON(+L) / **XML** (`__whatsapp` for WA) | Per-chat CSV / EML / MBOX / JSON(+L) / **XML** (`__whatsapp`) | Per-chat CSV / EML / MBOX / JSON(+L) / **XML** |
| **Peer phone** (`chat_identifier`) | yes | yes | yes (`name:` and the name when only a name is known) | partial (`name:` and the name if unresolved, `nameless:` for sent rows naming nobody) | partial (`name:` and the name if unresolved) | yes (JID → E.164) | yes (Apple chat id) |
| **Sender phone** (`sender_identity`, incoming) | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes (groups via sender JID) | yes |
| **Names** | yes (`<contactName>` in the XML) | yes (`contact_name` in the XML) | yes (mail headers) | partial (the rows; a name-only chat has no address) | yes (`Sender Name` on the rows) | yes (`wa.db` via wtsexporter) | yes (AddressBook) |
| **Direction** | yes | yes | yes | yes (`Is From Me` / Direction) | yes (`Type`) | yes (`from_me`) | yes (`is_from_me` in DB) |
| **Groups** | partial (PDU MMS) | yes (MMS) | partial (flat multi-address) | partial (two or more people wrote; no title) | partial (WhatsApp roster weak) | yes (title + sender phones) | yes (full DB roster) |
| **Attachments** | partial (PDU only; XML none) | yes (MMS) | yes (archive pairing heuristic) | no (flag only) | yes | yes (media paths via wtsexporter) | yes |
| **Media modes** (`clone`/`convert`/`compress`) | yes | yes | yes | no | yes | yes | yes (`clone`/`basic`/`full`/`disabled`) |
| **Contacts** | no | no | no | no | no | optional (`wa.db` / `ContactsV2.sqlite`) | optional (AddressBook database) |
| **Owner phone** (Import form) | required | required | required (+ owner email) | no | no | required (Android); optional (iPhone) | no |

Every converter takes names from the backup itself.
The **Contacts** row lists the only contacts files a converter reads: the WhatsApp contacts database and the Apple Messages AddressBook.
No converter reads a vCard (`.vcf`) or a vendor's contacts CSV.
Names from outside the backup come from the address book, Message Crate's own CSV that the server loads.
The rule "The address book is a file for editing contacts, not a source of them" in [contacts, identities and messages](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/blob/main/docs/architecture/contacts-identities-and-messages.md#rules) gives the reason.

## Deficiencies

| Exporter | Main gaps |
|---|---|
| **GO SMS Pro** | MMS as WAP-209 `.pdu` files; many empty stub PDUs; SMS attachments not in XML |
| **SMS Backup & Restore** | Call logs ignored; drafts / failed / queued skipped; encrypted ZIP not supported (unlock first) |
| **SMS Backup+** | Offline `.eml` only (no IMAP); call-log mails skipped; archive attachment→message pairing is guesswork; a peer known only by name gets a conversation of its own; a mail naming nobody is skipped and counted as a parse error |
| **OpenExtract** | No media extraction; a group is known only from two or more people writing in it, so one where only one other person wrote is read as one-to-one; thin source format; a chat the export names by a person's name only is matched to a contact by that name on import, or stays Unknown |
| **iMazing** | Reactions/replies are free text; WhatsApp groups lack full roster; naive dates are read in the zone chosen in the Import form's **Time zone of the messages** field |
| **WhatsApp** | Requires external `wtsexporter` (pip or bundled binary); a one-to-one chat whose JID is not a phone number (an `@lid` id) keeps the raw id, written as its participant with `identity_type` `other`; Status updates (`status@broadcast`) and Channel posts (`@newsletter`) are skipped and counted as `skipped_status_updates` and `skipped_channel_posts`; full group roster depends on upstream JSON |
| **iMessage** (`imessage-ir-exporter`) | No WhatsApp; reads the database through the separate `imessage-reader` program (GPL, shipped beside the app) because `imessage-database` is GPL and the app is not; needs Mac/`chat.db` or iOS backup; no TXT/HTML |

## Other dimensions

| | GO SMS Pro | SMS Backup & Restore | SMS Backup+ | OpenExtract | iMazing | WhatsApp | iMessage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **WhatsApp** | no | no | no | no | yes (CSV) | yes (native DB) | no |
| **Discord** | no | no | no | no | no | no | no |
| **Signal** | no | no | no | no | no | no | no |
| **Telegram** | no | no | no | no | no | no | no |
| **Slack** | no | no | no | no | no | no | no |
| **`participants_json`** | yes (unified CSV) | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| **Reactions / tapbacks** | no | no | no | no | free-text in `source_fields_json` | reactions in `source_fields_json` | each message's `reactions` (`reactions_json` in CSV) |
| **Deleted in the source app / Unsent** | no | no | no | no | no | no | each message's `deletion` (`deletion` in CSV) |
| **Edits / replies** | no | no | no | no | raw dates / free-text | reply in `source_fields_json` | each message's earlier versions in `edits` (`earlier_versions_json` in CSV) / thread GUIDs |
| **Source extras** | `pdu_*` (in `source_fields_json`) | `subject`, `message_kind`, `source_fields_json` | `smssync_id`, `eml_path` (in `source_fields_json`) | `source_kind`, `has_attachments` (in `source_fields_json`) | vendor cols (in `source_fields_json`) | `jid` / `key_id` (in `source_fields_json`) | `parts_json`, `app_json`, … |
| **Timezone** | XML/PDU epoch | XML epoch | EML dates | vendor `Date` | naive, zone from the Import form | epoch from wtsexporter | DB epoch + offset |
| **Skip diagnostics** | `skipped_*.csv` (invalid address, empty PDU, no party) plus run summary counters | run summary counters | run summary counters | unresolved phone count | run summary counters | run summary counters | run summary counters |

Discord, Signal, Telegram, and Slack are recognized services in the shared model (`IrService`), but no exporter parses those backup sources yet — they are future sources, listed as **no** until an exporter lands.

**Common message:** end-user [export structure](/docs/developer/reference/export-structure/); schema [message-ir architecture](/docs/developer/architecture/common-message/). All exporters parse to `ConversationDocument` then project via `message_ir_format::FormatSink` (per-chat JSON/JSONL/CSV/EML/MBOX, or one SyncTech `smses.xml` as the XML format). Output formats: [mail archives](/docs/developer/formats/mail-archive/) and [SMS Backup & Restore XML](/docs/developer/formats/sms-backup-restore-xml/). Attachment modes (none / copy / convert / compress) and obfuscate apply through `FormatSink` for every format.

**Convert:** [`message-reexport`](/docs/developer/formats/convert/) converts an existing Message Crate output directory to another format, detecting the input format from the directory. Export uses it for any format other than JSON Lines. Not a vendor backup source.
