The `message-reexport` package converts an existing Message Crate output
directory to another packaging format. The desktop app calls it as the second
step of an [Export](/docs/user/features/messages/export/) into any format
other than JSON Lines.

**Settings → Convert** in the desktop app rewrites a directory that already exists,
without going through the server.
The library reads all six formats and can convert between any pair of them.

**Formats and what each writes:** [Export formats](/docs/developer/reference/export-formats/)
