This reference describes the SMS and MMS XML structures consumed and preserved by the importer. It is not a replacement for SyncTech’s complete schema. Import behavior is documented in [import mapping](/docs/developer/formats/sms-backup-restore/mapping/).

Source: SyncTech’s [Fields in XML backup files](https://www.synctech.com.au/sms-backup-restore/fields-in-xml-backup-files/). Related SyncTech links:

- [Sample XML](https://synctech.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sms-sample.xml_.txt)
- [XSD schema](https://synctech.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sms.xsd_.txt)
- [Date field FAQ](https://www.synctech.com.au/faqs/what-is-that-number-the-date-field-in-the-backup-file/) — dates are Unix epoch milliseconds in UTC (for example `1400773261000` → 2014-05-22)

## File structure

Each backup is one file, named like `sms-20261001120000.xml`. The importer reads one file per run.

Root element: `<smses>` (current) or `<allsms>` (legacy).

Child message elements:

- `<sms>` — plain text SMS
- `<mms>` — MMS with nested parts and addresses

**Call logs are not supported.** Any `<calls>` / `<call>` elements in the backup are ignored.

Field values are generally copied as-is from the Android SMS/MMS databases. The backup app does little conversion.

## MMS messages (`<mms>`)

An MMS has three layers:

1. Attributes on `<mms>` (time, box, subject, address list)
2. Content in `<parts><part>…</part></parts>`
3. Recipients in `<addrs><addr>…</addr></addrs>`

### `<mms>` attributes

| `rr` | Read-report flag |
| `sub` | Subject, if any |
