Message Crate is two processes: the **server** (HTTP API and SQLite) and the **UI** that talks to it. This page is the map for someone who already compiles. Setup, tests, and pull requests stay on [Contributing](/docs/developer/contributing/). How messages move in and out is on [Message Transfer](/docs/developer/message-transfer/).

Related contracts: [HTTP API](/docs/developer/reference/api/), [Database](/docs/developer/reference/database/), [Export structure](/docs/developer/reference/export-structure/), and [Common message](/docs/developer/architecture/common-message/).

## Directory map

These are the folders in the repository. [Contributing](/docs/developer/contributing/) says which ones a first change should use.

```

## Binaries

`cargo build --workspace` produces these commands. `src-tauri/` is the desktop window. It is not a workspace member. The same exporter libraries run inside that app.

Three binaries are built: `message-crate-server` from `crates/server/server/`,
`demo-seed` from `crates/server/demo-seed/`, and `imessage-reader` from
`crates/helpers/imessage-reader/`. The last is not a command line. It reads
Apple Messages for the desktop app as a separate process, because the library
that parses `chat.db` is GPL and the app is under the Fair Core License; the
app starts it and speaks JSON lines to it over pipes. Everything else is a
library the desktop app links directly — the exporters have no command line.

The desktop installer carries two of these beside the app: `imessage-reader`
and `message-crate-server`, with the built website. The app starts the server
at `127.0.0.1:8080` when nothing answers there and stops it on close, so one
install is a working Message Crate. It is the same server program the Docker
image runs, given its data folder and address on the command line.
Why: [ADR 0001](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-no-command-line-except-the-server.md)
and its amendment.

| Library | Comes from | Job |
|--------|------------|-----|
| `imessage-ir-exporter`, `sms-backup-restore-exporter`, `whatsapp-exporter` | `crates/exporters/` | Supported extract → JSONL |
| `go-sms-pro-exporter`, `imazing-exporter`, `openextract-exporter`, `sms-backup-plus-exporter` | `crates/exporters/` | Rescue / experimental extract |
| `ios-backup` | `crates/libs/ios-backup/` | Check an iPhone backup before an import and decrypt one of its domains, through `imessage-reader` |
| `message-reexport` | `crates/libs/reexport/` | Convert an existing export folder |
| `message-crate-push` / `message-crate-pull` | `crates/libs/` | JSONL → running server / server → JSONL |

C4 PlantUML sources and SVG exports live in [`docs/src/assets/architecture/`](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/tree/main/docs/src/assets/architecture). Edit the `.puml` file, export SVG into the same folder, and commit both in one change.

## System context

A person uses the UI to import and view messages. The UI stores and retrieves them through the Message Crate backend.

![System context: a user talks to the user interface, which talks to the Message Crate backend.](../../../../assets/architecture/system_diagram.svg)

## Containers

Inside Message Crate the webpage and desktop app share `web/`. Both call the Rust API. The API reads and writes SQLite and attachment files.

![Container diagram: webpage and desktop app in a user-interface boundary, backend API, SQLite, and attachment storage.](../../../../assets/architecture/container_diagram.svg)

## Deployment (from source)

On a developer workstation the server process listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`. `cargo tauri dev` starts a native window and Vite on `:5173`. A browser can also load the UI from the server.

![Deployment: developer workstation with browser, Tauri plus Vite, the server process, and the repo filesystem.](../../../../assets/architecture/deployment_diagram.svg)

## Session sequences

Host processes:

- **Desktop App (Tauri)** — native desktop window started by `cargo tauri dev`
- **Vite :5173** — dev server that serves live `web/` source
- **Server :8080** — `message-crate-server` started by `./scripts/run-dev.sh`

### Start the server

Run the server with `./scripts/run-dev.sh`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Dev as Developer
    participant Desktop as Desktop App (Tauri)
    participant Vite as Vite :5173
    participant Server as Server :8080

    participant WebSrc as web/

    Dev->>Server: ./scripts/run-dev.sh
    Note over Server: cargo run -- serve. Restart this process after server-crate edits.

    Dev->>Desktop: cargo tauri dev
    Desktop->>Vite: Starts (npm run dev)
    loop Each window open or refresh
        Desktop->>Vite: Loads UI
        Vite->>WebSrc: Serves live
        Vite-->>Desktop: SPA assets
    end
```

### Log in

#### Prerequisites for logging in

- Server is running on `:8080`.
- Desktop App is running.
  - Vite is serving the WebView on `:5173`.

The developer types credentials in the SPA. Login is an Auth API call to the server, not a login to Tauri.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Dev as Developer
    participant Desktop as Desktop App (Tauri)
    participant Vite as Vite :5173
    participant Server as Server :8080

    participant DB as SQLite (data/messagecrate.db)

    Dev->>Desktop: Starts
    Dev->>Desktop: Enters credentials
    Desktop->>Server: Forwards credentials (Auth, API)
    Server->>DB: Reads account (sqlx)
    Server-->>Desktop: Session
```

### Import a backup

#### Prerequisites for an import

- Server is running on `:8080`
- Desktop App is running.
  - Vite is serving webview on `:5173`.
- User is logged in.

Messages and attachments are uploaded to the server using the `message-crate-push` library.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Dev as Developer
    participant Desktop as Desktop App (Tauri)
    participant Vite as Vite :5173
    participant Server as Server :8080

    participant DB as SQLite (data/messagecrate.db)
    participant Disk as data/ attachments
    participant Backups as Phone backup files

    Dev->>Desktop: Extract a backup
    Desktop->>Backups: Reads files (Extract / Format)
    Desktop-->>Dev: JSONL on disk

    Dev->>Desktop: Import into Message Crate
    Desktop->>Server: Upload attachments (Assets, API)
    Server->>Disk: Writes files
    Desktop->>Server: Import JSONL (Import, API)
    Server->>DB: Writes messages
```

### Export from Message Crate

#### Prerequisites for an export

- Server is running on `:8080`
- Desktop App is running.
  - Vite is serving webview on `:5173`.
- User is logged in.

Messages and attachments are downloaded from the server using the `message-crate-pull` library.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Dev as Developer
    participant Desktop as Desktop App (Tauri)
    participant Vite as Vite :5173
    participant Server as Server :8080

    participant DB as SQLite (data/messagecrate.db)
    participant Disk as data/ attachments
    participant Out as Chosen folder

    Dev->>Desktop: Export messages
    Desktop->>Server: Export messages (Browse / export, API)
    Server->>DB: Reads messages (sqlx)
    Server-->>Desktop: Message pages
    Desktop->>Server: Download attachments (Assets, API)
    Server->>Disk: Reads files
    Server-->>Desktop: Attachment bytes
    Desktop->>Out: Writes JSONL and attachments
```
