description: What each of the seven export formats produces on disk.
---

Message Crate writes an export in one of seven formats. Which one you get is chosen on the [Export](/docs/user/features/messages/export/) screen in the desktop app. This page describes what each format produces, so you can pick knowing what lands in the directory.

## What each format writes

| Format | Shape | Media |
|---|---|---|
| **JSON Lines** | One `.jsonl` per conversation, one JSON object per line | `attachments/` directory |
| **JSON** | One indented `.json` per conversation | `attachments/` directory |
| **CSV** | One `.csv` per conversation | `attachments/` directory. Columns: [CSV columns](/docs/developer/reference/csv-columns/) |
| **EML** | One directory per conversation, one `.eml` per message | Embedded in each message |
| **MBOX** | One `.mbox` per conversation | Embedded |
| **Android XML** | A single `smses.xml` | Embedded. Apple-only fields are dropped |
| **EML (SMS Backup+)** | One directory per conversation, one `.eml` per SMS or MMS | Embedded in each message. Other messages are left out |

Directory layout for the formats that use an `attachments/` directory: [Export structure](/docs/developer/reference/export-structure/).

## Which to pick

**JSON Lines** is Message Crate's own storage shape. It is the only format that loses nothing, and the only one it can read back in. Choose it for anything you may want to re-import.

**JSON** holds the same fields as JSON Lines, indented for reading. It is larger and slower to parse.

**CSV** is the format to open in a spreadsheet. It flattens each message to a row, so structure that does not fit a table — reactions, edit history, and per-attachment detail beyond the filename — is not represented.

**EML** and **MBOX** are mail formats, so a conversation opens in a mail client with its media attached rather than sitting beside it. MBOX puts a conversation in one file; EML puts each message in its own.

**Android XML** matches the SMS Backup & Restore schema, which is what makes it useful for moving messages back onto an Android phone. It is the lossiest option: fields that exist only on Apple platforms are dropped.

**EML (SMS Backup+)** writes SMS and MMS as the mail SMS Backup+ writes, with its `X-smssync-*` headers, so a person who brought SMS Backup+ mail in has it back in that shape. Message Crate's SMS Backup+ import reads it again, and any mail program can archive it. Messages that are not SMS or MMS are left out and counted in the run's log. Fields the database does not keep, such as the phone's message and thread ids and read flags, are not written. SMS Backup+ itself cannot restore these files: it restores only from an IMAP folder, and never MMS.

## How conversion works

Every export is written as JSON Lines first, then rewritten into the format you asked for. Only JSON Lines skips the second step.

The intermediate copy goes in the export's own directory in the Export Directory ([Settings → System](/docs/user/features/settings/system/#exports) names it), beside the converted files while they are written. When the export finishes, the copy is deleted and the converted files are moved up, so the directory holds only the result; a failed or cancelled export deletes the directory. A disk with room for one extra copy of the exported messages is enough.

Reading an existing export back in is a separate operation, on [Settings → Convert](/docs/user/features/settings/convert/). The `message-reexport` library reads every format but EML (SMS Backup+) and converts between them, and Settings → Convert calls it that way. EML (SMS Backup+) is read back by the SMS Backup+ import.
