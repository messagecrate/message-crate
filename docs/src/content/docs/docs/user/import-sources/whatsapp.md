description: Import WhatsApp from an Android phone or an iPhone backup. Advanced, because it needs a separate program and, on Android, a decryption key.
---

WhatsApp is the hardest source to import.
It belongs after a first import of [iPhone](/docs/user/your-messages/back-up-an-iphone/) or [Android](/docs/user/your-messages/back-up-an-android-phone/) messages has worked, not before.

Two things make it hard:

- The desktop app doesn't include the program that reads WhatsApp data. It must be installed separately ([issue 940](https://github.com/messagecrate/message-crate/issues/940)).
- On Android, WhatsApp's backup file is encrypted, and Import needs the key.

## Install wtsexporter

The desktop app runs [`wtsexporter`](https://github.com/KnugiHK/WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter), from the open-source WhatsApp Chat Exporter project.
It needs Python and [`pipx`](https://pipx.pypa.io/).

```bash title="Install wtsexporter"
pipx install "whatsapp-chat-exporter[android_backup,crypt15]"
```

`wtsexporter --help` prints the program's options once it is installed.

The desktop app has no setting for where `wtsexporter` is.
It finds the program when it is on the `PATH` the app was started with, or when the environment variable `WTSEXPORTER` holds the full path to it.

## WhatsApp on Android

### What Import needs

A directory that holds one of:

- `msgstore.db`, the WhatsApp message database, or
- `msgstore.db.crypt15` (or the older `.crypt14` or `.crypt12`), the encrypted backup of it, together with its key.

The phone number the WhatsApp account is registered to is also required, because an Android backup doesn't record it.

### Without root: the 64-digit key

WhatsApp can protect its backup with a key the person holds.

1. In WhatsApp, open **Settings → Chats → Chat backup → End-to-end encrypted backup** and turn it on.
2. Choose the **64-digit encryption key** in place of a password, and write the key down. A password can't be used for Import.
3. Run a backup from **Chat backup**.
4. Copy `msgstore.db.crypt15` to the computer. On the phone it is under `Android/media/com.whatsapp/WhatsApp/Databases/`. A WhatsApp `Media` directory beside `Databases` holds the photos and videos, and it is copied too when they are wanted.

The labels inside WhatsApp change between versions.
[WhatsApp's own help](https://faq.whatsapp.com/) describes the current ones.

### With root: the key file

A rooted phone gives access to WhatsApp's private storage, where the unencrypted `msgstore.db` and the `key` file live under `/data/data/com.whatsapp/`.
Rooting differs for every phone model and is outside this guide.
The [WhatsApp Chat Exporter documentation](https://github.com/KnugiHK/WhatsApp-Chat-Exporter) describes which files to copy.

### Fill in the Import form for Android

1. Open **Import** and choose **WhatsApp** as the source.
2. **Platform**: **Android**.
3. **Backup directory**: the directory that holds the `msgstore` file.
4. **Decryption key**: the 64-digit key, or the path to the key file. It is required when the directory has a `.crypt` file and no `msgstore.db`. The app never saves it.
5. **WhatsApp phone number**: the number the account is registered to. It is filled in from the profile.
6. **Contacts database**, **Media directory**, and **Message database** stay empty when those files are inside the backup directory.

## WhatsApp on iPhone

WhatsApp's data is inside the iPhone backup made in [Back up an iPhone](/docs/user/your-messages/back-up-an-iphone/).

The backup can be encrypted or not.
A backup that was encrypted for importing iPhone messages is used here as it is, with the same password.

### Fill in the Import form for iPhone

1. Open **Import** and choose **WhatsApp** as the source.
2. **Platform**: **iPhone**.
3. **Backup directory**: the device directory, the one that contains `Manifest.plist`.
4. **Encryption password**: the backup's password. It is required when the backup is encrypted, and stays empty when it is not. The app never saves it.
5. **WhatsApp Business** is turned on only for a WhatsApp Business backup.

For an encrypted backup, Import first decrypts WhatsApp's files into the import's working directory, which takes longer when the backup holds a lot of WhatsApp media. The decrypted files are deleted when the import finishes reading them.

The phone number is read from the backup.
When the backup doesn't hold it, Import uses **WhatsApp phone number** under **Processing Options (Advanced)**.

## Limits

- A run can't be cancelled while `wtsexporter` is working, or while an encrypted iPhone backup is being decrypted. It ends when that step finishes.
- Using files from two different backups together fails, because a key decrypts only the backup it was made with.
- Status updates aren't imported, because a Status is a post to many people that expires after 24 hours, not a conversation. The run summary counts them as `skipped_status_updates`. A reply to someone's Status is a message in the chat with that person and is imported.
- Channel posts aren't imported, because a Channel is a one-way feed from a publisher that nobody can write back to. The run summary counts them as `skipped_channel_posts`.

The run itself is the same as in [Import your backup](/docs/user/your-messages/import-your-backup/#start-the-import).
