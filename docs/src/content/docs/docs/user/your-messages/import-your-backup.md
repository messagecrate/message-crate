title: Import your backup

This step reads the phone's backup directory and stores its messages in the Message Crate.
It happens in the desktop app, logged in as the account made in [Create the Owner and an account](/docs/user/your-messages/create-the-owner-and-an-account/).

## Open Import

In the left panel, under **Messages**, select **Import**.

![The Import form with iMessage and iPhone backup selected](../../../../../assets/user-guide/import-form.png)

The Owner's login doesn't show **Import**, because the Owner holds no messages.

## Fill in the form

### For an iPhone backup

1. The first list is the source. Choose **iMessage**. It covers SMS and MMS as well as iMessage, because an iPhone keeps all three together.
2. **Platform**: **iPhone backup**.
3. **iPhone Backup Directory**: select **Browse** and pick the device directory of the backup, the one that contains `Manifest.plist`.
4. **Encryption password**: the backup's password. The field is marked required when the app finds the backup is encrypted, and optional when it isn't.

### For an Android backup

1. The first list is the source. Choose **SMS Backup & Restore**.
2. **Backup Directory**: select **Browse** and pick the directory that holds the `.xml` files.
3. **Backup Device Phone Numbers**: every number that belonged to the phone. The numbers on the account's profile are filled in already.

When none of the numbers in the field is on the account's profile, **Import** stays greyed out until **Allow import from phone numbers not on my profile** is ticked.
Adding the phone's number to the profile under **Settings → Profile** is the better fix, because messages sent from a number that isn't on the profile are not linked to the account.

### Attachments

**Attachments** stays on **Copy**, which uploads every photo, video, and file as it is.

**Convert** and **Compress & Convert** need the separate program ffmpeg, so they are left for a later import.
With **Copy**, a browser shows the formats it can show. Some iPhone photos and videos are in formats that not every browser displays, and those stay that way.
[Attachments and media](/docs/user/features/messages/attachments-and-media/) describes what each choice does.

## Start the import

Select **Import**.

For an iPhone backup, the app first compares the addresses the phone sent from with the ones on the account's profile.
When none match, it stops and lists the phone's addresses.
**Add to profile** beside an address adds that one address to the profile.
**Continue import** starts the run, whether or not an address was added.

## Follow the run

The screen changes to a list of stages, in order.
The run works through them from the top.

1. **Staging** reads the backup and copies the messages and attachments into a working directory on this computer. Nothing has reached the Message Crate yet. A large backup takes a while here.
2. **Staging Review** stops the run and reads **Awaiting approval**. It shows what was found: the contacts, split into **Existing** and **New**, any attachment too large to upload, and the addresses the phone sent from. The counts of conversations, messages and attachments are in the **Staging** row above it.
3. **Upload** writes everything into the Message Crate.

Nothing is stored until the review is approved.
**Upload to Message Crate** approves it.
**Cancel this import** ends the run and deletes the working directory.

The app can be used for other things while a run works, and the run waits at the review for as long as it takes.

## Check that it worked

The screen's heading changes to **Imported**, followed by the number of messages.

**View imported conversations** opens the conversation list, narrowed to what this run brought in.

A heading that ends in **with errors** means some messages or files didn't import.
The errors are listed under the stages, grouped by reason, and the messages that did import are in the Message Crate.

The record of the run stays under **Settings → Storage → Import history**.

## Importing again later

Importing the same backup twice doesn't create duplicates.
The Message Crate recognises messages it already holds and skips them, so a newer backup of the same phone adds only what is new.

## Delete the Demo Account

The Demo Account has done its job once real messages are in.
Deleting it is optional. It holds nothing real, and nothing in it mixes with another account.
While it exists, anyone who reaches the server can open it from the login screen.

1. Log out, and log in as the Owner.
2. On **User Accounts**, select **demo**.
3. Open **Danger zone** and select **Delete account**.
4. Confirm with **Delete account**.

The **Explore Demo Account** button leaves the login screen.
The Owner brings the Demo Account back under [Server Settings](/docs/user/features/owner/owner-home/#demo-account) with **Add Demo Account**.
