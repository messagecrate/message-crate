# web-next screens and features

A record of `web-next/`, the Next.js browse UI kept in the tree for evaluation,
captured on 2026-09-05 from the branch that made it an HTTP client of the server
(pull request #415, commit `c01560e4`). The product UI is `web/`; this document
exists so the two can be compared feature by feature. The comparison at the end
records what each app offers today. A feature present in one and absent from
the other is a fact about the two trees, not a verdict on either.

The screenshots are of the running app against the demo data
(`./scripts/run-vault-dev.sh --reset-demo`: 442 contacts, 382 conversations,
609,436 messages, no Contact Groups), in Chromium at 1360 × 860 with the
default dark theme. They live in [`web-next/`](web-next/).

## Running it

web-next reads from the server through the `/v1` HTTP API, the same way `web/`
does. It needs a running server and Node 22.

```bash
./scripts/run-vault-dev.sh --reset-demo   # server API on http://127.0.0.1:8080

cd web-next
npm ci
npm run dev                               # http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Log in as `demo` with an empty password. The server host comes from
`VAULT_API_URL`, default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. `npm run gen:api`
regenerates the response types from `docs/src/assets/openapi.json`.

Two costs are worth knowing before browsing. The Group Messages list splits
every conversation by calendar year, which costs one count request per
conversation per year: about four seconds for the demo's 185 groups. A search
with body text runs through the message list, and on the demo data an
unscoped text search takes about fifty seconds (issue #413).

## What works and what does not

Every read works: login, Home, the contact list and tree, direct and group
threads with paging, the source picker, find in conversation, the Group
Messages list, Trash, the three search modes, and the Settings pages.

Writes are not mapped. Every route handler that would change data answers 501
with "Not available: web-next reads the vault through /v1 and has not mapped
writes yet", so renaming, labelling, merging, trashing, importing a vCard,
changing the profile or password, and creating an account all fail visibly.
Undo and redo are not features of web-next: the history engine is unwired and
its controls are gone from the list menus.

Some reads have no `/v1` route and are approximated or absent. Display
preferences live in a browser cookie. Transcoded media is not served; HEIC and
MOV attachments show a notice with a link to the raw file. Trash timestamps,
per-message trash, "delete messages only", surrounding-context search,
relevance ordering, the import-source filter on lists, the duplicate-copy
count, contact CSV export, unassigned handles, demo reset, and Hanko login
are all listed with their nearest routes in issue #412. Two behaviours were
observed on this build: right-clicking a message search result opens no menu,
and clicking a message hit opens the conversation and then walks it back one
page of 80 at a time until it reaches the message, so a hit from 2014 in a
long thread takes a while to appear.

## Screens

### Login and account creation

`src/components/LoginScreen.tsx`. User ID and password with a show/hide
toggle. "Create a new account" unfolds a second form below: User ID, password
and confirmation, a "No password" option, display name, and a phone number
entered as a USA number or in international form with the E.164 value shown
beside it. Account creation posts to a route that answers 501 on this build.

![Login](web-next/login.png)

![Create a new account](web-next/create-account.png)

### Home

`src/components/HomePageClient.tsx`. Overview tiles for messages, contacts,
group chats and attachments; recent contacts with last-message date, group
count and direct-message count; a vault history panel with date range,
sent/received proportion, import sources and duplicate copies; and Explore
tiles for all contacts and contacts with no messages, the second of which is a
prefilled search.

![Home](web-next/home.png)

### Navigation

`src/components/AppSidebar.tsx`, `LabelsNav.tsx`, `VaultTitleMenu.tsx`. The
title menu holds Logout. Labels have a "+" popover for creating one, and each
label row carries a rename and delete menu. The navigation collapses to an
icon rail and its state persists.

![Create label popover](web-next/create-label.png)

![Navigation collapsed to an icon rail](web-next/nav-collapsed.png)

### Contacts

`src/components/BrowseShell.tsx` and the `Browse*` components. Three
resizable panes: the contact tree, the thread reader, and a details inspector.
Rows show initials, name, formatted handle and a handle-type chip, with
optional message-count, group and date-range badges from Settings. Letter
headers group the list. A filter field narrows it. The toolbar has a contacts
sort menu (first name, last name, phone number, message count, group count),
a year filter for the group rows, a group-row sort menu (date, message count,
people) and a "⋯" actions menu.

![All contacts](web-next/contacts-all.png)

Expanding a contact shows a "Direct messages" row and the group conversations
the contact takes part in, collapsed to one row per conversation. Opening the
direct row fills the reader and the inspector: handles, message and
attachment counts, first and last message, and activity by year.

![Contact tree, direct thread and inspector](web-next/contact-direct-thread.png)

Checkboxes appear on hover; shift and ctrl extend the selection. The inspector
shows the selected contacts and the tree adds the group conversations they
share.

![Three contacts selected](web-next/contacts-selection.png)

Right-clicking a contact opens New contact, Edit, Labels and Delete contact.
"Merge into…" appears for a contact with no name. The list's "⋯" menu adds
Import VCF, Export contacts CSV and Delete group messages. Delete and merge
are disabled by a capability flag that predates this build.

![Sort contacts menu](web-next/sort-contacts-menu.png)

![Year filter for group rows](web-next/year-filter-menu.png)

![Sort group rows menu](web-next/sort-chats-menu.png)

Clicking a name in the inspector opens the edit form: display name, a labels
picker, and handle rows with a type selector (Phone, Email, Username, Other)
that grow as they are filled.

![Edit contact form](web-next/contact-edit-form.png)

### Thread reader

`src/components/BrowseThreadPane.tsx`, `ThreadFindBar.tsx`,
`MessageAttachments.tsx`. A year strip jumps between years and follows the
scroll. The source picker shows Combined plus each import source that carries
the conversation. "Photos & files" narrows the thread to messages with
attachments. Messages page newest first; scrolling up loads older pages and a
floating "Newest messages" button jumps back. Find in conversation (Ctrl+F)
counts matches, steps through them and highlights the term. Day separators sit
between calendar days. Images render inline, other files as links, and missing
or unplayable media as labelled placeholders.

![Find in conversation](web-next/thread-find.png)

![Photos and files filter](web-next/thread-photos-files.png)

### Search

`src/components/VaultSearchField.tsx`, `AdvancedSearchForm.tsx`,
`Search*ResultsList.tsx`. The search field accepts web-next's own query words
and autocompletes people and labels for `with:`, `from:`, `to:`, `within:`
and `in:`. The chevron opens an advanced form with two tabs. Contacts: within
a label, handle, first name, last name, phone, first and last message dates,
group and direct message counts. Messages: within, from, to, with person, has
the words, doesn't have, subject, date, message type, source, attachment,
file type, filename, larger and smaller than, results mode, sort and context.

![Advanced search, Contacts tab](web-next/advanced-search.png)

![Advanced search, Messages tab](web-next/advanced-search-messages.png)

Results come in three modes. The default is one row per conversation with a
match count, snippet and date range. `group:none` gives one row per message
with sender, timestamp, text and attachment names. `search:contacts` gives
contact rows that expand to their matching conversations. Each list has a
select-all, a sort menu and a "Show more" row.

![Search results by conversation](web-next/search-conversations.png)

![Search results by message](web-next/search-messages.png)

![Search results by contact](web-next/search-contacts.png)

### Group Messages

`src/components/GroupMessagesShell.tsx`, `BrowseGroupChatsPane.tsx`. Every
group conversation, one row per conversation with its participants and message
count, with a year filter and a sort menu (date, message count, people).
Checkboxes select rows for trashing. Opening a row fills the reader and the
inspector with participants, counts, dates and activity by year. Selecting
several rows shows a selection summary.

![A group thread with its inspector](web-next/group-thread.png)

![Two groups selected](web-next/group-selection.png)

### Trash

`src/components/TrashShell.tsx`, `TrashUnifiedList.tsx`. Two tabs, Contacts
and Group Messages, each with a count; a search field; select-all; Restore and
Delete forever; and a read-only preview of the trashed item on the right. The
demo data has nothing in Trash, and the server reports no trashed-at time, so
the list is empty here.

![Trash](web-next/trash.png)

![Trash tab picker](web-next/trash-tabs.png)

### Settings

`src/components/Settings*Form.tsx`, `ThemeSettings.tsx`,
`DateTimeSettings.tsx`. Four tabs. Account: user ID, change password or sign
in without one, display name, phone numbers, and a danger zone for deleting
all messages or the account. Access: a view-only mode that blocks edits while
browsing, and one API token to generate or delete. Storage: attachment usage,
import history, and the largest attachments. Appearance: list badge toggles,
contact initials, light and dark theme with four colour seeds, a share string,
preset swatches, and date and time formats with custom patterns.

![Settings, Appearance, date and time](web-next/settings-appearance-datetime.png)

### Label sections

`src/app/no-label/page.tsx`, `label/[slug]/page.tsx`, `no-messages/page.tsx`.
The same browse screen scoped to one label, to contacts with no label, or to
contacts with no messages. The demo data has no labels, so only "No label"
is reachable.

![No label](web-next/no-label.png)

## Feature inventory: web and web-next

What each app offers today, by area. The web column comes from `web/src/`
(the Vite SPA, with desktop-only items marked); the web-next column from
`web-next/src/`. A web-next entry describes what the screen offers; on the
current build, every write answers 501 as described above. "—" means the app
has no such feature.
