/**
 * Render a component that fetches server data.
 *
 * Anything using `useRouteQuery` needs two things from the tree: a query client
 * to cache into, and a logged-in account to name the cache entry after. This
 * supplies the first. The second comes from `useAuth`, which tests fake in the
 * usual way — see `mockedAuth` below for the shape.
 *
 * The client is built once per mounted `Providers`, so no test can read a
 * cache another test filled, and retries are off so a rejected request fails
 * the test at once rather than after a delay.
 *
 * "Once per mount" rather than "once per render" is load-bearing.
 * `renderHook(...).rerender()` re-renders the wrapper, so a client built in
 * the component body was a different, empty cache on every re-render — which
 * left the tests that assert TanStack Query keeps two conversations in two
 * entries asserting it against a cache that was being thrown away underneath
 * them. `useState` holds one client for the life of the mount instead, so
 * those tests read the cache they mean to.
