 *
 * Every button in `web/src/` that runs an action is one of the two, so press,
 * hover, focus-visible and disabled behave the same everywhere
 * (`web/STYLE_GUIDE.md`, rule 4). A button that stays pressed, such as Find,
 * is React Aria's `ToggleButton`.
 *
 * A focus ring uses `focus-visible:`, because the button itself takes focus.
