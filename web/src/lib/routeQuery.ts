/**
 * The one way the web app fetches and remembers server data.
 *
 * TanStack Query does the remembering, the duplicate-request suppression, the
 * loading and error state, and the "this is stale now, refetch whoever is
 * showing it" broadcast. Nothing here reimplements any of that; the only thing
 * this module adds is the rule that every cache entry is named with the
 * logged-in account.
 *
 * That rule is the point. Before it, four modules kept the account's data in
 * module-level variables and `auth.tsx` cleared them by hand from two separate
 * lists — both of which named the same four and omitted the fifth, so a second
 * account could be shown the first account's Saved Searches. Naming the account
 * in the key makes that impossible rather than merely unlikely: a second
 * account asks for an entry that has never been written, finds nothing, and
 * fetches.
 *
 * See `docs/adr/0002-one-way-to-fetch-data-in-the-web-app.md`.
