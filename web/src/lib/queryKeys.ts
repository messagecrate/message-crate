/**
 * Every cache key the web app uses, in one place.
 *
 * A key is built here and nowhere else, for one reason: TanStack Query finds
 * entries by prefix, so an optimistic write can only patch "every contact
 * list" if something owns the words `contacts` and `list`. When keys were
 * literals typed at each call site, that knowledge lived in comments, and
 * screens kept their own override maps rather than trusting a prefix they
 * could not name. Marking entries stale needs no prefix from here: every
 * write marks the whole account's cache stale (`invalidateAccount` in
 * `routeQuery.ts`).
 *
 * One rule, for every resource: a namespace whose `all` is the prefix, with
 * the builders nested under it. The account is not here — `routeQueryKey` puts
 * it in front of whatever these produce, so no key in this file is complete on
 * its own. See `docs/adr/0002-one-way-to-fetch-data-in-the-web-app.md`.
