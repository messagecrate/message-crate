 * the cancel flag stopped, one that threw or left no report, a conversation
 * the server did not take (a server that stops answering part-way fails
 * every later conversation and the push moves on), a conversation left
 * unsent, and an Upload that sent nothing at all. The push journal leaves
 * every such conversation for the next push, so resuming sends only what is
 * missing. Pausing on a failure keeps those conversations reachable: a run
 * recorded as finished would delete the directory they are staged in.
 *
 * A finished Upload with item-level problems is `completed_with_issues` —
 * unless `approved` already told the user about them: the plan the user
 * approved at their last gate (spec decision 15 — Gate 2's plan when there
 * was a media pass, Gate 1's otherwise) is diffed against the issues the
 * run reported, and a skip the plan already forecast is not news. Without
