 * screen, and what follows here is a login.
 *
 * This is the first half of creating an account, not the whole of it. The name
 * and phone numbers are not asked for here — the account opens with an empty
 * profile, which sends the user straight to profile setup, and only finishing
 * that leaves them with a fully set up account. The action is labelled
 * "Continue" for that reason.
