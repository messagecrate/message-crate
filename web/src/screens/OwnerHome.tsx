/**
 * Owner Home: where the owner lands at login and works from, the way
 * any other account lands in Messages.
 *
 * The frame is the one every account sees: the header with the product name,
 * a search bar and the account button, over a side panel and a content pane.
 * What fills it is the owner's own. The owner has no conversations, no
 * contacts, no import, no export and no trash, so the side panel lists
 * Dashboard, Server Settings, User Accounts, Audit Trail and Logs, and the
 * search bar filters the accounts table. Dashboard shows what the whole
 * database holds, and Audit Trail what each user did and when. Logs shows only
 * its name: nothing is built behind it yet.
 *
 * `/owner/accounts/{id}` is one account's Settings, the screen its holder
 * sees, opened from the gear in the account's row. The owner's own row
 * opens the owner's own Settings, which is also where the account button's
 * Settings goes. `/owner/accounts/new` is the same screen for an account that
 * does not exist yet, which Add account opens in place of the table. See
 * `docs/adr/0008-the-owner-holds-no-messages.md`.
